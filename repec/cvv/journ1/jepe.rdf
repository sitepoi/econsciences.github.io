Title:  The Correlation between the Internationalization Processes and Performance of Firms: The Case of Emerging Market Firms of the BRIC Countries
Abstract:  In this empirical study we examine the correlation between the internationalization processes and financial performance of firms by focusing on the emerging market firms (EMNCs) that originate from the BRIC countries. We test the shape of the internationalization - performance curve and explore the differences on effectiveness of the sectors. Our sample data that is collected from the World Scope database that includes a total of 239 firms in which 13 of the firms are from Brazil, 58 of them from China, 156 from India, and 12 from Russia. The internationalization activities take place during the period of 2000   2010. Our results suggest that using only the first order term FSTS and second order term FSTS^2., demonstrates a positive relationship between DOI and ROA, a negative relationship between DOI and ROE, and DOI and ROS, and a positive relationship between DOI and ROA, DOI and ROS, and a negative relationship between DOI and ROE. The sign of the coefficient for FSTS are negative and for FSTS^2, positive. This result confirms the previous theories that financial performance decreases in the beginning of the internationalization processes, then increases with the expansion of international operations. These results are statistically significant and propose a U-shaped relationship between the financial performance of EMNCs and their degree of internationalization.

Title:  Internationalization of post-Soviet Economists: Evidence from Central Asia and the Caucasus
Abstract:  After the collapse of socialism, post-Soviet republics reorganized economics curricula, published new textbooks, and trained students and academics in their home countries or in the West. How did these efforts change the quantity and quality of international publications of post-Soviet economists? The results of this study show that the number of international publications increased gradually. These publications usually concern regional issues and are published in low impact journals. The preference of Russian language journals implies that language is a barrier to publish in international journals. Cooperation with Westerners is found to contribute positively to their publication performance.

Abstract:  After 1990, the crises in planned economies has resulted with accept of the free market system and disintegration of this country blocks. The transition economies are defined as process of approaching work to the free market system of markets. Privatization efforts especially in finance markets of transition economies have increased interest to these markets of foreign banks. From the studies concern with enter of foreign banks to the market show that there are both advantages and disadvantages. In this study, the relationship between the allocation of credit and the presence of foreign banks in transition economies examined for the period of 1995-2010.

Title:  Stock Market Development, Bank Concentration, Ownership Structure, and Bank Performance: Evidence from Turkey
Abstract:  Using the the Two-Step Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) described by Arellano and Bond (1991) for dynamic panels, this paper analyzes the profitability of 25 commercial banks in Turkey over the period from 2003 to 2011.Our profitability determinants include bank-specific characteristics as well as industry-specific and macroeconomic factors, some of which have not been considered in previous studies. We conclude that the high bank profitability during these years is associated with a large percentage of loans in total assets, a low proportion of liquid asset, good efficiency and a low doubtful assets ratio. In addition, higher capital ratios also increase the bank s return, but only when return on assets and return on equities is used as the profitability measure. We find evidence of economies of scale in the Turkish banking sector. Empirical results show that there is a negative relationship between financial development and profitability. We find also there is a positive relationship between bank concentration and bank performance in Turkish banking industry, consisting with the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) hypothesis. The results also suggest that there is a negative relation between the foreign ownership and profitability, indicating that foreign banks do not in general make relatively higher profit, at least during the period under the consideration.

Title:  The Determinants of NPLs in Emerging Europe, 2000-2011
Abstract:  The emerging Europe has been hardest hit by the surge in the non-performing loans (NPLs) in the aftermath of the global financial turbulence and the crisis-induced recession. The surge in the NPLs generated a severe banking distress, and left a legacy of a debt overhang that dramatically constrained bank lending and served as a drag on economic growth in the post-crisis period. We quantitatively study the determinants of loan losses in static and dynamic panel models with a focus on the linkages between the macro-financial vulnerabilities and a wide range of bank specific variables in 20 emerging European countries during 2000-2011. Our results indicate that the NPL dynamics have been particularly sensitive to real GDP growth, and inflation, while bank profitability as a proxy for management quality plays a significant role in constraining loan defaults. By contrast, higher lending rates may lead to adverse selection problems, and hence reduces loan quality. There is also some weak evidence that rapid credit growth as a measure of excessive risk taking in lending serves as a precursor to worsening loan portfolio quality. We observe, based on a unique data set, that banks in the region increasingly employ advanced risk management regimes (Internal Rating Based, IRB) with the potential to better monitor and evaluate loan quality and hence, rein on problem loans.

Title:  The Global Contradiction of the 21rst Century
Abstract:  As global temperatures keep increasing and the amount of Co2 equivalent stuff in the atmosphere is at record level, the key links between GDP growth, energy consumption expansion and greenhouse gases emission increases must be more researched, although economic growth and ecological capital has been much debated: Can they today be combined to give both prosperity and environmental sustainability? On the micro level, many projects show that this is indeed possible. But on the macro level, global emissions of greenhouse gases follow the advancement of country affluence closely. The link is the constantly increasing need for more energy, provided by fossil fuels. The G20 policies are probably forthcoming too late to avoid disasters.

Title:  The Political Economy of Italy in the EMU: What Went Wrong?
Abstract:  Although Italy was amongst the most enthusiastic founding members of the European Economic Community in 1957, the Italian capacity to respect the imperatives of European integration could not, and, still, cannot, be given for granted, as the recent sovereign debt crisis demonstrates. Apart from the many structural inconsistencies that persist not only in the economic, but also in the political and social organization of the country, also the public debate is sometimes characterised by a tendency to blame the process of Europeanisation for the less palatable decisions taken by the national institutions. This article addresses the sub-national, national and supranational dimensions of the process of Italian Europeanisation focusing in particular on the role of domestic socio-economic actors in influencing monetary policy decision making processes. The article is based on field research conducted by the author both in Italy and Brussels. The main object of this research effort was to analyse to what extent the outcomes of the process of European monetary integration have been influenced by domestic politics and by domestic economic interest groups in Italy with the final aim of assessing the impact of Italian entry into the EMU and especially its future within it. Thus, at the core of this research lies the following question: What is the role of domestic politics and domestic interest groups in monetary policy-making? The theoretical starting point of this interpretation of the process of European monetary integration is represented by an integrated domestic-foreign policy focusing on the role of economic interest groups in defining national exchange rate and monetary policy decisions. It is not here the place to discuss the different theories explaining the process of European integration and, more specifically, of the issue of European monetary integration. Here it will simply be underlined that, to explain foreign economic policy choices, policy outcomes need to be linked to domestic politics.

Title:  Making sense of China's Economic Slowdown
Abstract:  This paper aims to review the factors inducing China's successful economic transformation, so as to find the causes of the subsequent economic slowdown, from the New Institutional Economics (NIE) viewpoint and the Marxian viewpoint, respectively. The former school is primarily concerned about the "supply-side" driver (changing rules of game for producers) of increasing economic output and efficiency, while the latter is basically sharing with the Marxian concern of the "demand-side" driver (an egalitarian pattern of income distribution which underpins mass-consumption) of increasing economic output and sustainability. NIE emphasize that unless a free and open market for ideas is created, China cannot sustain its economic growth or advance itself into a global centre of technological innovation or scientific discovery. However, this paper points out that the creation of an active market for ideas would not always guarantee the sustainability of economic growth, drawing the lessons from Japan's experiences. This paper suggests that it takes more or less several years to create an active market for ideas to transform to a new phase of post-industrialization. In addition, in the phase of post-industrialization, rapid product obsolescence is brought by severe competition in which rival firms are accelerating the introduction of competitive products to the market, which may expose innovative firms to fundamental uncertainty.

Title:  Reflections on the Impact of the New Economic, Sociological and Historical Institutionalism in Institutional Social Policy
Abstract:  This paper intends to make a reflection and analysis of the impact of theoretical and methodological frameworks of reference on different neo-institutional approaches in social policy. The paper questions the functionality and continuity of the institutions that are responsible for the functions of designing and implementing programs of social policy, given the profound changes on the environment of economic globalization processes. The method used primarily focuses on critical analysis and reflection. It is concluded that the institutions of welfare and social security must develop the technological, organizational and administrative skills to create and maintain institutional effects that go beyond being conductive to efficiency, effectiveness and equitable development.

Title:  Turkey s Strategic Economic Relations with Africa: Trends and Challenges
Abstract:  The Ottoman Empire had extensive economic relations with Africa which provides the structural frameworks for the speedy acceleration of economic partnership and trade interactions between Africa and modern Turkey. This study seeks to examine the structural relevance, challenges and prospects of Turkey s economic relations and interest in Africa from the traditional period of Ottoman Empire to the contemporary era of competitive interdependence. From a broad perspective, trade interactions between Turkey was driven but the values of economic pluralism and less of colonialist tendencies. Therefore, the greatest challenge that tacitly limits the geometric expansion of trade is the shift in perception of Africa as a hub for disease, economic stagnation, waste and wars. This form of stereotype is a direct input of neo-colonial propaganda adopted by the Western media to keep at bay competitive investors from Africa. So, Africa with an economic growth rate of over 5% offers Turkey new horizon for economic diversification. The consistent use of soft power by Turkey has brought new image and perception of Turkey as a credible economic partner with pragmatic approach promote symbiotic trade relations devoid of the manipulative devices of free market syndrome that benefits only the West at the detriment of Africa. Africa sees Turkey as an economic partner that will assist the continent to intensify the industrialization of its economic base in line with the global economic configuration. Therefore, Turkey-Africa economic partnership and trade volume is likely to expand in future because Turkey s opening to Africa has created new markets and investment potential that will increase Africa s participation in global economy and enhance Turkey s role as a major player in the politics of resource allocation in the international economic system.

Abstract:  We examine the relationship between trade balance and net export with both, the official and real effective exchange rates on the J-Curve hypothesis and find evidence to support in favor of the hypothesis, coming from a panel data of 49 developing countries from Africa. Countries can improve their current account balance by depreciating their currency; however the J-curve hypothesis argues that such changes take time to occur, but should use exchange rate policies discreetly, as it belongs to the  beggar thy neighbor  policies. This may be good for home country but is not so good for the foreign country; as a result, such policies may trigger retaliatory policies. Restrictive trade policies are against the present day notion of free-economy and free-trade policy these are very common around the world.

Title:  Futures and Forwards Contracts from Perspective of Islamic Law
Abstract:  Futures and forwards contracts are considered of the main derivatives contracts, which offer many services and benefits, namely risk management (hedging), and speculation. However, these contracts from the perspective of Islamic experts are varying and non-uniformed, where there are those who see futures and forwards contracts as unacceptable and forbidden by Islamic law, and there are also those who see futures and forward contracts as acceptable and compatible with Islamic law. This paper attempts to clarify the Islamic law perspective of futures and forwards contracts, to give a clearer picture about the legitimacy of these contracts, in order to examine whether the using of futures and forwards contracts are permissible or prohibited. The study follows the inductive method and descriptive research by displaying texts, previous literature, opinions of futures and forwards contracts from Islamic law perspective and comparisons between them, including the balancing and elicitation in light of Islamic law standards, strength of the arguments relied upon by each party and commitment to offer the presentation matter scientifically. The study s conclusion the current application of futures and forwards contracts in the financial markets are impermissible and are considered prohibited contracts. The study find futures and forwards contracts contain a number of forbidden elements in Islamic law, especially gambling and harm speculation additions to a number of pictures of some forbidden elements such as gharar (ambiguity), riba (usury) that are still in the circle of debate among Muslim scholars. However, the availability of a some terms and conditions that can dispose the prohibited elements in these contracts may make them compatible and consistent with the Islamic law.

Title:  Does Financial Openness Affect Economic Growth in Asian Economies? A Case Study in Selected Asian Economies, 1980-2010
Abstract:  In recent decades, financial liberalization has been one of the most important strategies for Asian countries to promote growth. However, debate emerges following several financial crises on whether liberalizing financial markets and allowing for free access to international capital markets, would benefit or impede economic development. The objective of this study is to examine the impact of financial openness on select seventeen Asian economies and answer the three questions: 1. Is there any linkage between financial openness and economic growth for these seventeen Asian countries? 2. Does any of the financial openness pose positive or negative effects? 3. If no direct impact revealed, can financial openness still have growth effect under certain fundamental or institutional conditions? Our main findings are as follows: 1. By employing both de jure and de facto indicators of financial openness, our empirical results indicate that the de facto indicators are associated with growth of Asian economies but de jure indicator does not show statistically significant impact on growth across three methodologies. 2.Furthermore, these growth effects vary among the de facto indicators. According to our empirical results, out of the four de facto financial openness measurements, only one of them, foreign direct investment inflows, influences growth positively whereas three other measures, including foreign direct investment outflows, portfolio investment inflows and outflows exert negative impact on growth. In terms of the view that the growth effect of the financial openness depends on macroeconomic foundations or institutional conditions of an economy, our findings do not support this view due to the estimation results are not robust across five financial openness proxies.

Title:  Agrarian Crisis and Transformation in India
Abstract:  This paper examines the changes taking place in the agriculture sector in India, especially since the launching of neoliberal reforms in 1991.Indian agriculture continues to employ the vast majority of the people but in recent years it has experienced a slowdown in growth rates. This sector is experiencing unprecedented crisis with low productivity, high rural unemployment and food insecurity. In the past, availability of credits to farmers, along with subsidies on new inputs were as important determinant of investment in agriculture. Since the nationalisation of commercial banks in India in 1969 and until 1980 the country followed the policy known as  social and development  banking. However, with the launch of liberalisation policies, the government became very critical towards such policies, and it was argued that the banks should function on a commercial basis. India has experienced GDP average growth rates of 7% for the last nearly a quarter century. However, emphasising the overall growth rate can be misleading, as it does not tell us about the sectoral composition of growth. The growth rate in agriculture sector has been much slower. With the modernisation and development of manufacturing and services, the agriculture sector has declined, as happened in the East Asian economies. However, in India the decline in the agricultural contribution to GDP is not accompanied by a similar degree of employment expansion in the manufacturing sector.

Title:  Who have been the most harmed by the crisis? Evidence from Spain
Abstract:  The aims of this research are to assess the initial impact of the current economic crisis on poverty and social exclusion in Spain and to identify the most vulnerable sectors of society. We apply Probit models to Spanish Income and Living Conditions Surveys of 2007 and 2009 to analyze income poverty and financial function ings of basic material deprivation linking pecuniary and health aspects. Our results show an increment of poverty, above all, extreme poverty, and a worsening of the deprivation risk not only for those with a weaker position in the Spanish labour-market, but for employers and self-employed, as well.In addition, we found changes in risk factors such as educational level and age. These findings should be taken into account when designing the regulatory reforms of social policies and labour market regulations.

Title:  Guyana: A Half a Century of Struggles with Planning, Growth, and Development
Abstract:  Guyana was a proving ground for both the capitalist and socialist development ideas in the latter half of the 20th century. We analyze the problems and solutions for those experiment from the point of views of appraising their performances. Traditional theories such as input-output models, sectorial models, and growth models form the windows for the appraisal. When the subject matter is judgmental, Analytic Network Process and (ANP) and Data Envelop Analysis (DEA) are engaged. When the subject matter is structural, the time series of gross investment to GDP is considered as a driver of growth. We subject that ratio to spectral and cross-spectral analysis for a half a century of data for Guyana vs. neighboring countries. The results indicate that Guyana has stepped into the long-run cumulative growth process after its struggles with development.

Title:  Fiscal Transparency, Measurement and Determinants: Evidence from 27 Developing Countries
Abstract:  Fiscal transparency has been consistently identified as a key feature of efficient fiscal policy and a prerequisite for good public governance. However, measuring fiscal transparency remains an empirical challenge, and extant literature on developing countries is still sparse. To that end, this paper examines the determinants of fiscal transparency in developing countries. We add to the existing literature by proposing a new replicable index of fiscal transparency that is consistent with the definition provided by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Additional determinants of fiscal transparency, which are exclusively relevant in the study of developing countries, are also examined. In particular, we introduce such factors as natural resources, the openness of the economy, the literacy rate of the population, and the quality of institutions. Because of possible endogeneity arising from interdependence among some variables, two-stage least squares (2SLS) is used to ensure that the estimators are consistent. As a robustness check, the same estimation procedure was replicated by replacing our index of fiscal transparency with respectively the index of Andreula et al. (2009) and the Open Budget Index, both of which use a significant similar number of developing countries of our selected sample. The results provide additional credence to our suggested procedure. The paper found that the level of natural resources and the openness of the capital account negatively affect fiscal transparency. However, the quality of institutions and literacy were found to positively affect fiscal transparency. The findings of this paper provide an explanation of why, after a decade of fiscal transparency programs, many developing countries are still lagging behind, thereby losing the potential benefits mentioned in the literature. These findings could help guide policies directed at improving fiscal transparency in the case of developing countries.

Title:  Paper Lives: Certification vs. Licensure
Abstract:  Since the mid-1990s certification has increasingly been considered as a tool to increase the chance to find job particularly by youngsters. However under the circumstances that exist today it is known that having certificates does not automatically lead to get job, even contrary job seekers may remain jobless after they pay huge amounts of money to certfication firms. The very fast increase in the number of certfying firms confirms the fact that there is an ongoing demand for short term qualification courses. Another process which accompanies to private certification is that the loosing ground in public education that despite corporations still care about diplomas in hiring they reject job applications in the case of absence of certificates. In this study certification as a popular phenomenon has been compared with licensure in the context of waged engineers and their chambers. As a consequence of the analyses made for this study, it may be concluded that there is a capital accumulation which is carried out via two layers of working classes: masses who are obliged to be certified and waged laborers who work in certification industry in order to improve skills of those who are in need to be certified. During reviewing of literature it has also been witnessed that the academic writings focusing on the numbers, wages and working conditions of trainers hired by certification firms is virtually non exist. Therefore study suggests further researches especially on waged trainers working in private certification firms.

Title:  Revisiting Neoclassical Economic Growth: A Survey in the Literature
Abstract:  During the second half of the twentieth century economists have build newer models of economic growth that consider policy influences of growth and divergent outcomes among countries. These models address issues concerning economic growth, operation of financial markets, trade policy, government expenditures, and taxation. In this essay we have revisited the interdependence of political and economic institutions, taking the neoclassical growth model of Solow (1956) as a point of departure, which maintains that long run economic growth can be explained by capital accumulation, population growth and technological progress. We first discuss the evolution of the neoclassical school of economics in a historical context, and the role of various institutions in engendering economic growth. Subsequently the role of government spending, political stability, property rights and special interest groups (SIG s) affect economic growth have been discussed, and how these institutions can explain different countries to grow at divergent rates and achieve different levels of wealth.

Title:  Learning Heckscher-Ohlin Model in Five Easy Steps
Abstract:  With students in the policy and business schools with no formal economics background in mind, we propose an intuitively appealing and simple step-by-step graphical approach to explain the Heckscher-Ohlin (HO) model. Our approach is simple because it needs only two pieces of information, specifically about factor endowments and factor intensities, and from there it uses straightforward logic to construct the HO model. In easy five steps we show how to build the HO model and derive its three theorems, specifically, pattern of trade, factor price equalization, and income distribution.

Title:  Sabri Ulgener, Economic Sociology and Turkey.
Abstract:  According to the approach of economic sociology, economics should include a social perspective. Because economy is a part of society, therefore it cannot be analyzed by isolating from the rest of the society. The best works of Old Economic Sociology is done by Max Weber. According to Max Weber, capitalism is born from Protestant Ethic and its values. For Weber culture is like conductor working at railways switching the ways of the train. In this study, the birth and development of economic sociology, which is a relatively young social science, will be told. Besides a dignified Turkish economist, Sabri lgener s views will be explained in this study. Sabri lgener had written a lot of books and articles for explaining the economic mind of Muslim-Turk people.

Title: A Weberian Critique of Weber: Re-Evaluation of Sabri F.  lgener s Studies on Socio-Economic Structure of Turkey.
Abstract: Efforts to understand the transformation that has been experienced in Turkey for two centuries in the areas of politics, economics and intellect indispensably lead us to Sabri F.  lgener. His unique approach in examining socio-economic changes, his different methodology and concepts that are developed by him; his researches stemming from economics and expanding through law and literature are referred as important initiations for understanding the differentiation in world-view (zihniyet) through huge historical changes.  lgener, actually investigated the process of modernization in historical manner from a theoretical approach. In this manner, his analysis on world-view is a valuable contribution in offering explanations for current modern transformations after Ottoman society. As it is indicated in many studies abou him,  lgener is one of the exceptional thinkers who can use the data that were collected through many fields like economic, sociology, history and literature in his researches. In this article, theoretical framework of  lgener s analysis on world-view is to be examined in a critical view of point..

Title: Globalization, Poverty And Role Of Infrastructures.
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to complement the theoretical and empirical literature on the globalization-poverty nexus. Based on a simple model of social welfare, the paper demonstrates that the different types of globalization have different effects on social welfare. The main empirical findings suggest that globalization contributes to poverty reduction but with a larger magnitude in the presence of infrastructures instruments. It follows that good quality of infrastructure is a necessary condition for a higher globalization effect on poverty reduction. The empirical evidence also supports the idea that globalization driven by the reduction in information access cost and the removal of barriers to their dissemination has the greatest impact on poverty reduction. Finally, the study discusses the economic policy implications and suggests in particular investment in adequate ICT and energy infrastructures for globalization to contribute significantly to the reduction of poverty.

Title: Making a Consensus between Economics Sciences and Islamic Ethic in Turkey.
Abstract: Many economists in Turkey think that economic thought and national values should come together. According to Sabri Ulgener, economic models which internalize national values are more realistic and healthy. He thinks that development solutions which are inspired from our national culture and value system will be more successful. Besides, Ulgener thinks that economy and society should unify. This unification can be realized by only with a model which is suitable for our citizens and country. According to him, every country would find his way for independence by itself but, it must be realized according to its local conditions. Therefore in this study, it is advised that we have to make a consensus between economic thought and Islamic Ethic in Turkey to avoid social problems which are arising from fast liberalization.

Title:  Transformation towards overseas-oriented expansion: the evolution of Hyundai Motor Group s production structure.
Abstract:  In this paper, we analyze the Hyundai Motor Group s newly evolved-production structure to illustrate the evolution of a corporate system. Specifically, we explore why Hyundai Motor Group s domestic-oriented production structure could be maintained until the more recent history of Korea s domestic automobile market. Our findings show that since 2012, the Hyundai Motor Group s production structure which has been affected by internal and external factors in the automobile market has transformed from a domestic-oriented production structure to an overseas-oriented production structure. Our findings further demonstrate that both technical factors embedded in the Hyundai Motor Group s production system and non-technical factors that strive to equate the production conditions in the Group s foreign and domestic facilities support the smooth operation of the overseas-oriented production structure.

Title:  Relationship between Economic Growth and Debt: An Empirical Analysis for Sub-Saharan Africa.
Abstract:  In this study, we examine the connection between economic growth and debt, with the question in mind - Is debt a burden and bad for economic growth? Employing several sophisticated statistical approaches to investigate the problem and to assess the impact of debt on economic growth in 48 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa from 1995 to 2012, we find evidence of Granger causality between debt and economic growth in 8 out of the 48 sub-Saharan countries during the period of study and validate for the existence of  Debt Laffer Curve.  We also study the relationship between debt and economic growth rate in Granger causality and Dynamic Arellano-Bond panel data estimation frameworks, and find evidence of a negative correlation between the two variables (Debt and GDP) and confirm the findings by testing several versions of the models. Political decision and economic policy are intertwined and need to be examined carefully when implemented for economic growth and our findings lend credence to the politically unpopular austerity measures (constraints on government spending financed by borrowing). There is a limit to the economic growth rate that the government financed expenditure can bring. If the burden of debt is too high then there is a negative impact of debt on the economic growth.

Title:  Reviewing Taylor rules for Brazil: was there a turning-point?
Abstract:  This article finds evidences highlighting that the Brazilian monetary policy is divergent from Taylor principles, from data over January 2005 to May 2013, and using regressions estimated by OLS and GMM. Especially, the inflationary expectations do not show robust effects on the Selic rate, while the inertial degree of the latter denotes a current pro-cyclical bias. Furthermore, the article tested for the effects of the Subprime crisis and the domestic currency undervaluation on the Selic level. The empirical results suggest that the Subprime crisis monetary authorities have preferred to stabilize or expand output, against the inflation stabilization, despite the Brazilian inflation target regime since 1999.

Abstract:  This article looks into broader context of FDI policy in the European Union. It examines key aspects defining the available space for conducting the policy towards incoming and outflowing investments. From investigating general economic and political settings some conclusions as to the scope of FDI policy can be drawn. Changing international environment including the rise of Chinese OFDI, negotiated Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and internal EU developments mainly Lisbon Treaty provisions as to the common investment policy, shape the FDI policy space available for the EU members.

Title:  Some features of investing SMEs in Kosovo
Abstract:  Small and medium enterprises play an important role in the economic development of a country, especially for transition countries, since constitute the largest participative economic structure of these countries. Their role is crucial for these countries to resolve problems arising from the transformation process in these countries. Kosovo is a country that is in a process of late transition. Development of SMEs depends on their ability to grow and develop. This paper is based on data collected from surveys of SMEs by BSC Kosovo in late 2012 and aims to provide some features of the investing SMEs in Kosovo by observed them as a whole as well in particular by micro, small and medium category enterprises. The analysis has to do with the features that characterize SMEs which had investment activity. Our analysis suggests that investment as important variable SMEs had positive correlation with the size and age of the enterprise. Also investing SMEs are characterized by recruitment of new employees in the last year, having written a business plan and used of bank loans. SMEs that operate in two or more locations, as well as those with importing activity are characterized by the investment activities. Investments have no significant correlation with the sector in which the company operates, but generally dominate trade SME which dominate the economic structure in Kosovo. Investments of services enterprises have a downward trend with increasing the size of the company, while the manufacturing enterprises shows a positive trend in this regard, since their participation is increasing investment in enterprises with increasing the size of the enterprise.

Title:  Empirical Estimation of GDP determinants, Household Consumption Expenditure and the Consumption Multiplier in Pakistan (1985-2011)
Abstract:  Present study empirically estimates the impact of consumption on Gross Domestic Product in Pakistan using annual data for 27 years (1985-2011). Stepwise regression method is applied on GDP as dependent variable and several other variables like Household Consumption, Foreign Direct Investment, International Trade, Domestic Savings, Value Addition in Industry, Agriculture and Services Sectors taken independent of each other, External Debt, Remittances, Gross Capital Formation and Population as independent variables. The empirical results suggest that the change in GDP is significantly explained from the change in Agriculture and Services Sectors  Value Addition, Gross Domestic Savings, External Debt and Household Consumption. The Standardized Beta values of the coefficients of accepted variables suggest that the household final consumption expenditure is the biggest determinant of GDP out of the accepted variables. Further the consumption multiplier has been estimated from the estimated value of marginal propensity to consume (MPC) which suggests that rise of each Pakistani rupee (local currency) in household income leads to a rise of PKR 0.821 (Pak Rupee) in household final consumption. Further, given the MPC value, through induced expenditure, the multiplier effect is thus estimated at 5.587.

Abstract:  This paper is a review about the book  Stress Test: Reflections on Financial Crises  by Timothy Geithner. The book mainly discusses the policy decisions and implications of T. Geithner during his job as New York FED president and US-Treasury secretary under president Obama. The book reveals some hidden information about the decision-making process in both institutions. But it lacks a scientific foundation in order to explain the financial crisis in more detail. Hence, I think the book is less convincing than recognized in public. No doubt, Geithner crisis response deserves appreciation especially the  Stress Test . However, the overall book does not demonstrate that the response is sustainable in the long run and scientifically sound. Consequently, it is more a book on public policy and governance than economics.

Title:  Transnational Entrepreneurship: A Interview with Lebanese-American Restaurateur Charbel Saliba
Abstract:  Literature on transnational entrepreneurship, while expanding, leaves much to be desired. For instance, there is paucity of qualitative surveys that capture the  voice  of a real life transnational entrepreneur. This article aims to contribute to the academic and business literature by showcasing the viewpoint of a Lebanese-American transnational entrepreneur. Charbel Saliba is a successful ethnic restaurant owner in Illinois, USA. Through an interview conducted by Dr. J. Mark Munoz of Millikin University, with the assistance of business student Matthew Herek, Saliba shares his thinking on transnational entrepreneurship and its implications on his business.

Title:  Teeth Whitening and Occupational Licensing
Abstract:  The case for occupational licensing, whether for physicians or teeth whiteners, is highly problematic. This paper makes the case for a free market system in certification of quality in medical and dental care, and much else. Purpose: To explore occupational licensure as an infringement of liberty. Design/methodology/approach: a logical and empirical analysis. Findings: teeth whitening regulations serve as an anti-competitive barrier to entry. Originality/value: applying the concept of entry restrictions is not original; applying them to teeth whitening, is. This is of value in that for economic liberty to be promoted, schemes against it such as this one must be analyzed and exposed.

Title:  Struggle for Regulatory Power between States and the US Federal Government: The Case of Workers  Compensation Insurance 1930-2000
Abstract:  This paper contributes to our understanding of the power struggle for regulatory control between the states and the US federal government, especially during the Progressive and Great Society eras. By focusing on one substantial social insurance program   workers  compensation insurance   the effects of competition between the federal government and the states over regulatory control are demonstrated. Calls for greater generosity in the early 1970s, and the threat of a federal takeover of workers  compensation insurance induced dramatic and lasting changes.  States reacted to the federal government s recommendations and neighboring states  actions by raising benefit levels. A comprehensive index of expected monetary wage-replacement benefits across the US between 1930 and 2000 is constructed to demonstrate the variation over time and across states.

Title:  Egalitarianism Policy and Effective Demand under Globalization
Abstract:  The study examines egalitarianism policies in terms of the relationship between labor and capital and extends the model developed by the economist Bowles. We introduce the demand factor to the Bowles model (2012), which discussed the effectiveness of the income and asset redistribution policies in a global economy. The improvement of productivity and the decrease in the ratio of monitoring labor through asset-based redistribution increase the real wage rate because of its lure for foreign capital. At this point in the Bowles model, the labor supply increases and then employment increases. In contrast, in our model, with the addition of the demand factor, the improvement of productivity increases employment, but the decrease in monitoring labor does not always increase employment as both demand and supply increase. This means that asset-based redistribution in a global economy is not always effective.

Title:  The Limitations of Reductive Wealth Redistribution Strategies for Curtailing Inequality in the Era of Global Capitalism
Abstract:  Poverty and inequality are in all likelihood the most pernicious problems in contemporary life. They contribute greatly to a wide and diverse range of suffering, injustice, and social ills. They have existed since the incipient forms of society emerged, and have plagued nearly every society. They have provoked criticism and resistance across millennia and geographic regions, and were inciting factors for many revolutions and social movements. There is evidence that inequality is rising globally, with economic growth and global capitalism as the primary culprits. Marx s theory of infinite accumulation and Ricardo s scarcity principle relate inherent structural qualities of wealth in capitalism to inequality and divergence in income and wealth. Abundant evidence shows that inequality will continue to increase unless there are political and economic measures to oppose it, and that inequality has increased since industrialization. The aims of these strategies is to promote income convergence, usually via reforms to taxes, redistribution, or minimum wage. Two of the most prominent proposals to curtail inequality are Piketty s global tax rate and Standing s basic income. However, neither sufficiently accounts for structural limitations in capitalism, such as those described by Marx and Ricardo, as well as Piketty s study of greater growth rate of capital over income (r>g) and free market ideology. They fundamentally rely upon reductive redistribution and particularly money and income, which do not necessarily contribute to parity in wealth. In structural Marxism, inequality is created and perpetuated by the structural base and super-structure, and both must be somehow reformed or altered to achieve lasting and significant equality. In this paper, I approach inequality with this in mind, and propose a form of paternalism as a means of ensuring wealth redistribution achieves lasting equality.

Title:  Internal Absorption and Foreign Direct Investment Inflows: A new approach towards Market Size
Abstract:  In continuation of the efforts to understand the dynamics of internal market, this study proposes Internal Absorption as an instrument for measuring market size for economies which confront large trade deficit over a longer period of time. The study empirically examines the impacts of Internal Absorption along with trade openness and gross private investment on FDI inflows in Pakistan. The ARDL approach to co-integration and ECM based on ARDL is used to test the existence of long run relationships among variables for the period 1976-2009. The result establishes strong positive relationship between Internal Absorption and FDI inflows in short as well as in the long run.

Title:  Dynamic Links between Exchange Rates and Stock Prices in Malaysia: An Asymmetric Cointegration analysis
Abstract:  The present article used a monthly data and applied Enders and Siklos (2001) asymmetric cointegration analysis to examine the impact of exchange rates on stock prices in Malaysia for the period of 1999-2014. The result suggests that variables were cointegrated based on Engle-granger two step technique. Moving to threshold auto regressive (TAR) and momentumthreshold auto regressive (M-TAR) the finding reveals that based on the latter variables were asymmetrically cointegrated as null hypothesis of no cointegration was rejected at 1% significance level based on Enders and Siklos (2001), while the former shows that variables do not have long-run relationship and the speed of adjustment is symmetric. This signifies that increase in the prices of shares in Malaysian stock market could lead to Malaysian Ringgit appreciation over other major global currencies. The stocks will become more expensive and discourage foreign investors  participation in the market which inhibits the influx of stable foreign capital into Malaysian financial system. The implication is that regulators should ensure that adequate and efficient policies are put in place in order to keep the Ringgit exchange rates at optimal level so as to enhance the participation of foreign investors and improve market competitiveness.

Title:  Sarmila Banerjee & Anjan Chakrabarti (Eds), Development and Sustainability: India in A Global Perspective
Abstract:  The edited volume presents an engaging cartography of Indian economy following two decades of liberalization on the backdrop of globalization and problem of sustainability - two defining moments of post-reforms reorganization of the economy. A wide variety of sector-specific and economy-wide studies in the collection, examine the central tenets of market-centric reforms representing globalization. The research works dealing with micro- and macro-aspects of development help us form an idea of important issues, emerging debates, dominant institutions and changes required for attainment/restoration of efficiency. Most of these writings indicate the limitations of current developmental logic in their specific settings. These studies also propose measures to tackle the problems faced while presuming growth-sustainability disconnect to be temporary in nature. A number of studies introduced new analytical categories and empirical frameworks to capture current reality in better and more meaningful ways. A third strand of writings portrays conflict between the project of globalization and issue of sustainability as a distinguishing characteristic of global capitalism although the present policy framework accord highest priority to capitalist expansion. This conflict however, has put the Indian state in a perpetual act of balancing the growth objective of global capital and welfare objective meant for those experiencing exclusion in the development process.

Abstract:  he book, Great Divergence and Great Convergence:  A Global Perspective, represents an insightful analysis of the processes associated with historical change, specifically those processes that have given rise to the current state of the world system.  Uniquely, the authors suggest that continuity of process extends to both the Divergence and Convergence.  Further, they suggest that the time depth of the origin of this process is much deeper than the traditional marker of the mid-17th Century and build a strong case for this assessment.  Finally, Grinin and Korotayev make some predictions regarding the further effects of the process of convergence into the near future, predictions suggesting a significant reshuffling of world system organization and the rise of a global middle class.

Title:  Inflationary Dynamics in Guatemala
Abstract:  Short-run price dynamics for Guatemala are analyzedusing a linear transfer function methodology.  This approach has previously been employed for other national economies such as the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, and Nigeria. The data for this study range from 1960 to 2010.  Inflation is measured using the consumer price index.  Explanatory variables include the monetary base, real output, interest rates, and the exchange rate. Allof the estimated coefficients exhibit the arithmetic signs hypothesized by the theoretical model. Almostall of the parameter estimates satisfy the 5-percent significance criterion and all exhibit economically plausible magnitudes. Estimation results indicate that although monetary policy effects begin to materialize within twelve months of implementation, the bulk of the impacts associated with the money supply do not occur until the second year after any monetary policy action is taken.

Title:  Political Influence on Creating of Saving-Investment Gap in Transition Countries
Abstract:  Governments of transition countries should become aware of the importance of implementation of such an economic policy that would encourage higher saving rates and at the same time bringing it in accordance with investment rates in order to achieve other important macroeconomic goals, without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability of their respective economies. Transition countries EU members have not conduct such an economic policy, which resulted in existence of a substantial difference between total investments and gross national savings in their countries. Although the influence of saving on investments was significant, conducting of economic (investment) policy of the right-wing governments of the transition countries EU members has more influenced imbalance of saving and investment in comparison to the left-wing governments. Should the right-wing governments, in applying of economic measures that stimulate higher investment rate than previous, follow their ideological point of view instead of turning to 'middle' voters, they would have an easier position in reducing saving-investment gap and in achieving macroeconomic stability in comparison to the left-wing governments. However, should the right-wing governments turn more opportunistically to 'middle' voters, instead following their ideological programme, that would make their position difficult in reducing saving-investment gap, because influence of saving to investment would be significantly lesser. Increasing of saving rate with left-wing governments would have significantly weaker influence on balancing of saving and investment in comparison to the right-wing governments, but their opportunistically turning to 'middle' voters would create slightly better position in realizing of macroeconomic stability, because by this their influence on reducing saving-investment gap would be improved compared to the situation when they would follow their left-oriented party programme.

Title:  Early Warning Signs of the Economic Crisis in Greece: A Warning for Other Countries and Regions
Abstract:  Warning signs about the developing economic crisis in Greece were present in the growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and in the growth of the GDP well before the economic collapse. The growth ratewas strongly unstable. On average, in less than 50 years, it decreased 10-folds but after reaching a low minimum it quickly increased 6-folds only to crash before completing the full cycle. The decreasing growthrate was leading to an asymptotic maximumof the GDP but it was soon replaced by a fast-increasing growth rate propelling the GDP alonga pseudo-hyperbolic trajectory, which if continued would have escaped to infinity in 2017. Such a growth could not have been possibly supported. Under these conditions, the economic collapse in Greece was inevitable.

Title:  The lean versus clean debate and monetary policy in South Africa
Abstract:  This paper contributes to the lean versus clean debate by examining whether or not monetary policy in South Africa leans against the wind or cleans up after the bubble has bust. This is achieved by analysing the behaviour of asset prices during the different phases of monetary policy stance. The models that allow the behaviour of the asset prices to differ during periods of tight and easy monetary conditions as well as during periods of contractionary and expansionary monetary conditions are specified. The results provide evidence of an asymmetric behaviour between monetary policy interest rate and asset prices during the periods of easy and tight monetary conditions. The empirical results further provide evidence of symmetric behaviour between themonetary policy interest rate and asset prices during the periods of contractionary and expansionary monetary conditions. Thus monetary policy in South Africa supports the proposition of leaning against the wind as opposed to the proposition of cleaning up after the bubble has burst.

Title:  Decision-Making in the Hong Kong Bank Stock Market
Abstract:  This paper investigates the decision-making of small investors in the Hong Kong bank stock market.The objective of this study was to search the factors, investing characteristics, and decision-making processes that affect Hong Kong small investors who participate in bank stock market.The results suggest that we can derive the following ascending order of importance of factors:reference group, stock nature, returnsperformance and bank performance. Reference group is the least important factor and bank performance is the most important factor. We used Kendall rank correlation coefficients to measure thedifferent ranking of factorsand are therefore attempting to give advice for financial advisers approaching target customers in Hong Kong.

Title:  How did the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis Influence Turkish Firms
Abstract:  This paper investigates whether 2007-2008 global financial crisis hadan effecton Turkish firms. For this purpose, we investigated the firm-specific factors affecting the stock returns of firms in the BIST-XU100 in the 2004-2009 periods. The period was divided into two sub-samples, namely pre-crisisand during-crisis periods. Moreover, the effects of firm size, market-to-book ratio (MB), and price-to-earnings (PE) ratio on stock return were examined using feasible generalized least-squares (FGLS) and panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) models. In the literature, the US subprime mortgage crisis meltdown and spillover effects were studied on different countries and different stock markets. In this study, not only crisis effects but also effects of firm-specific factors were considered. Integration levels of the series were investigated by panel unit root tests. The models were used for both sub-samples, and the results of the two models werecompared. The results showed that. Size and MB variables were significant in all the periods and had positive effects on the stock return of the firms, and the global financial crisis hada significant but weak effect on Turkish firms.

Title:  Alvaro Cencini & Sergio Rossi, Economic and Financial Crises: A New Macroeconomic Analysis
Abstract:  Thereviewed bookdevelops a newparadigm regarding economic and financial crisesat both the national and international level.That paradigm rests on the purely numerical and vehicular nature of money, from which Cencini and Rossi infer the fundamental laws governing a monetary economy of production. The pathologies of the economic system are then characterized in light of these laws. In order to avoid the recurrence of crises, the authors eventually put forward a reform of the domestic and the international payment systems, which rests on a distinction between money, income and fixed capital developed throughout the book. After a short introduction, this review offers a description of the book and ends up drawing some implications, especially as pertains to the nature of money and the characterization of crises.

Title:  Donatella della Porta, Social Movements in Times of Austerity: Bringing Capitalism Back Into Protest Analysis
Abstract:  Over the last few years, there has been a certain degree of agreement among social movement scholars on the fact that the dominant analytical frameworks of social movement theory were not fully able to explain the recent wave of protests, triggered by the economic crisis. Followingthis concern, some authors have started a debate about how to modify and refine these frameworks in order to better account for the current dynamics of mobilization. This type of reflection is precisely at the centre of the analysis of a book recently published by Polity Press (2015: pp. 249), titled Social Movements in Times of Austerity. Bringing Capitalism Back into Protest Analysis, where the author, Donatella della Porta, one of the most prominent scholars of this field, takes a clear position in such debate by singling out some of the main limitations, which have negatively affected the developments of the theorizations of social movements over the past decades. In discussing these limitations, della Porta proposes some original remedies and solutions in terms of theories and themes to be introduced and investigated in the current agenda of social movement research.

Title:  Size and Development of Tax Evasion in 38 OECD Coutries: What do we (not) know?
Abstract:  For the first time we develop a time series of tax evasion (in % of official GDP) for 38 OECD countries over the period 1999 to 2010 based on MIMIC model estimations of the shadow economy. Considering indirect taxation and self-employment as the driving forces of tax evasion, we observe a declining trend of tax evasion between 1999 and 2010 for all countries. The average size of tax evasion across all 38 countries over the period 1999 to 2010 is 3.2% of official GDP. The country with the highest average value is Mexico with 6.8%, followed by Turkey with 6.7%; at the lower end we find the United States and Luxembourg with 0.5% and 1.3%, respectively.

Title:  Dynamical Methods Applied in Natural Resource Economics
Abstract:  This paper presents, in brief, the fundamentals of optimal control theory together with some notes for differential games, which is the game theoretic analogue of the optimal control. As it is recommended by literature references the main tool of analysis in open loop information structure for environmental models is the Pontryagin s Maximum Principle, while the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation is the tool of analysis for any closed loop informational structure. As applications of the above theoretic considerations we present some environmental economic models which are solved both as optimal control problems and as differential games as well.

Abstract:  In the absence of convincing evidence, data for Sweden and Mauritius are used in academic publications to illustrate the Demographic Transition Theory. These data are closely examined and found to be in clear contradiction of this theory. Demographic Transition Theory is also contradicted by the best available data for England. Other examples of contradicting evidence are also discussed.

Title:  Estimating Aggregate Demand in Egypt.
Abstract: This econometric study seeks to determine the most important factors of aggregate demand in Egypt so as to provide insight into how this developing nation can grow economically in the coming years. The Ordinary Least Squares estimation method was used in order to estimate nominal GDP for the time period 1975 to 2009. Based on the results the real interest rate, the inflation rate, the growth rate of government expenditure, and the growth rate of the money supply are the most statistically and economically significant factors of the growth rate of nominal GDP for the coming year. A one percent change in the growth rate of the previous year government expenditure is predicted to cause the growth rate of the current year nominal GDP to increase by 54%.The role of government expenditures on public sector wage expansion is discussed in this study as to shed light on this factor s significant influence on income inequality post-1975 in Egypt, which will continue to impact nominal GDP and social conditions for the developing nation in the coming years.

Title:   Porter vs Krugman : History, Analysis and Critique of Regional Competitiveness
Abstract: The subject of this study is to determine the competitiveness through an interdisciplinary approach of the theories of the new economic geography and regional economy. This article describes in detail the theory of competitiveness, which is defined differently by many authors, with particular emphasis on opposing views of Michael Porter and Paul Krugman. One of the first writers who stressed the importance of the geographical position was Michael Porter. In his model, the author emphasizes that the geographical concentration of firms enhances productivity, innovation and export sector. Following this theory, many authors have focused on the research of the "location problem ", which led to better connection of economics and geography. The result of these activities is the new guidelines that have been developed, such as the new theory of economic geography and regional economy. The new economic geography is mainly related to the Nobel prized, Paul Krugman, whose theories often conflict with those of Porter. This study initially sets out the views of both authors, in terms of competitiveness and then attempts to make a comparative analysis between the theories they developed.

Title:  Current Trends in the Economic Development of the Participating in the Tripartite Free Trade Area Regional Economic Communities
Abstract: The Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the East African Community and the Southern Africa Development Community are three of the eight regional economic communities that are recognized by the African Union as building blocks of the African Economic Community. The three RECs recently concluded the negotiations to establish the Tripartite free trade area on a tariff-free, quota-free, exemption-free basis by simply combining their existing free trade areas. The multiplicity of trading arrangements in southern and eastern Africa, ranging from bilateral agreements between individual countries to free trade areas and customs unions, poses a huge implementation challenge to the deepening and development of the process of economic integration thus the creation of the Tripartite free trade area can be regarded as a step in the right direction. The paper aims at presenting the economic properties of the economies in the three RECs participating in the negotiations on the Tripartite FTA with a special focus on the analysis on intracommunity trade as an indicator for the current state-of-art and the perspective of the integration process in the three RECs. It presents the aims, principles and main challenges of the Tripartite FTA negotiations. Then it examines thoroughly the three participating RECs in terms of the economic properties of their member states and the trends in their international trade. Some conclusions are drawn on the integration potential of the participating RECs as well as on the possibilities presented by the creation of the Tripartite FTA.

Title:  China in the World Economy
Abstract: After several decades of widely admired success in raising its gross national product (GNP) and becoming the world s second largest economy behind the United States, doubts have recently emerged about the sustainability of China s impressive economic success unless it undertakes major reforms and changes its growth model. Opinions vary, however, about China ever attaining the same level of growth that had been achieved in past decades, particularly since the 1978-79 reforms. Sometimes, expressing the present realities and forecasting the future is affected by the measures used, the observer s expectations, and perceptions of what can or cannot be done to deal with current issues and problems. Often, it is a matter of perceiving the glass as half full or half empty. For some observers, the growth model, adopted since 1978-79, has been extremely successful in gaining the objectives sought, To others, that model resulted in many unintended consequences such as a wide disparity in incomes and excessive emphasis and reliance on manufacturing and exports at the expense of the service sector and domestic consumption. What cannot be disputed, nevertheless, is the fact that millions of Chinese have been lifted out of poverty, and incomes per capita have substantially increased. Instead of depending on foreign assistance, China is now an aid- giver and a major player in world economic affairs. This paper examines the current economic status of China, its transition from one of the poorest countries in the world, to become a middle income country despite the fact that it has a huge population of 1.3 billion people, and the imbalances that have emerged and have to be corrected to ensure sustained economic growth.

Title:  Determinants of Export Competitiveness: Evidence from OECD Manufacturing
Abstract: Many of the OECD countries are known for having a substantial share of manufactures in their exports. This study aims to analyze the determinants of export competitiveness in manufacturing sector of 12 OECD countries over the period 1999-2010. For this purpose, firstly RCA index for manufactures exports is calculated. Then panel data techniques are employed to test the effects of physical capital, labor cost, infrastructure, R&D, the share of high-tech exports and FDI inflows on export competitiveness of manufactures. The results of the study indicate that conventional variables, namely physical capital, labor cost, and infrastructuremostly determine the export competitiveness of manufacturing sector in OECD countries. Furthermore, FDI inflows to the manufacturing sector has not contributed positively to the export competitiveness of OECD countries for the last decade. On the other hand, R&D variable and the share of high-tech exports have shown positive effects on export competitiveness of manufacturing sector.

Title:  Teaching Economics and Providing Visual  Big Pictures 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate the importance of providing visual  big pictures  in the teaching of economics. The plurality and variety of concepts, variables, diagrams, and models involved in economics can be a source of confusion for many economics students. However, reviewing the existing literature on the importance of providing visual  big pictures  in the process of learning suggests that furnishing students with a visual  big picture  that illustrates the ways through which those numerous, diverse concepts are connected to each other could be an effective solution to clear up the mentioned mental chaos. As a practical example, this paper introduces a  big picture  that can be used as a good resource in intermediate macroeconomics classes. This figure presents twenty-seven commonly-discussed macroeconomic diagrams in the intermediate macroeconomics course, and gives little detail on some of these diagrams, aiming at helping students to get the whole picture at once on a single piece of paper. This macroeconomics big picture mostly focuses on the routes through which common diagrams in macroeconomics are connected to each other, and finally introduces the general macroeconomic equilibrium that is graphically derived through those connections.

Title:  Decomposition of Natural Gas Intensity in Energy-Intensive Industries in Iran
Abstract: Natural gas is main energy carrier used across industrial sector in Iran. The macro-level policy is to substitute natural gas for other oil products due to environmental and economic impacts. In this article, the natural gas intensity in energy-intensive industries is decomposed into output, structural and pure intensity effects in Iran during the period 1971 to 2011. The increasing share of value added as a proxy for structural changes represents a significant impact on reducing natural gas intensity. The output effect is of the high estmagnitude in changing natural gas consumption, and the pure intensity and structural effects rank the second and third in terms of the overall change in natural gas use, respectively.

Title:  Equality of Opportunity in Education: A Case Study of Chile and Norway
Abstract: One of the most important determinants of the distribution of income and life opportunities is education. Increasing levels of formal schooling have contributed to raise standards of living and eradicate extreme poverty worldwide in recent decades. However, inequality in the distribution of income  which is the single most important indicator of relative access to material well-being- remains stubbornly high in most regions of the world. In this paper, I focus on two countries, Chile and Norway, which have very different educational systems, and follow the same analytical methodology of Sch tz et al (2008) to detect differences in equality of opportunity between the two countries. In a slight variation, the family-background effect here is represented by a larger number of variables  including household income-, in order to pinpoint the specific characteristics that it comprises in each country. Surprisingly, I find that the family-background effect is stronger in Norway than in Chile, which would denote a potential higher inequality. However the higher achievement inequality in Chile is determined by other factors, which need urgent reform.

Title:  Monopoly Capital and Capitalist Inequality: Marx after Piketty
Abstract: This paper proposes that one major explanation of growing inequality in the United States (US) is through the use of the concept of economic surplus. The economic surplus is a neo-Marxian term which combines the traditional Marxian tenet of surplus value with other ways that surplus value can be invested in a mature, advanced capitalist economy. A rising economic surplus that is not absorbed through growing consumer spending, luxury spending or government spending results in stagnant wages and growing inequality via higher levels of underemployment and greater monopoly and monopsony power among a decreasing number of huge, powerful corporations. Therefore, the politics surrounding the growth of inequality in the US has to be understood first by understanding over accumulation of the economic surplus by those at the top of the US capitalist class.  This research note gives estimates of the rising economic surplus over the last several decades in the US as well as how these correlate with the level of inequality. The growth of the economic surplus gives rise and form to the politics of inequality and austerity.  As time goes by, the politics of inequality and austerity in the US will be manifested by greater corporate influence in the political system, greater political polarization, less government effectiveness, and more debates about welfare spending, corporate taxation, taxes on upper income households, and taxes on wealth.

Title:  Interest rate and Economic Growth as Determinants of Firm Investment Decision: An Investigation on BIST listed firms
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of political uncertainty as a determinant of investment decisions on investment decisions of firms. For this purpose, this study involves 147 BIST (Istanbul Stock Exchange) listed firms displaying activity in the industry sector between 2008 and 2013. Panel data analysis with relevant quarterly data was used to analyze the relationship between political uncertainty and investment decisions of firms. Analysis results have revealed a statistically significant relationship between investments of firms and the variable representing 29 March 2009 General Local Elections, 12 June 2011 General Elections and 12 September 2010 New Constitution Referendum as an indicator of political uncertainty. This verifies the argument suggesting an uncertainty due to elections may negatively affect investments of firms through inefficient capital allocation, and this can be said to provide a strong message with regard to important economic effects of political uncertainty.

Title:  Scott B. Sumner, The Midas Paradox: Financial Markets, Government Policy Shocks, and the Great Depression
Abstract: In a study with detailed evidence and technical economics, Scott Sumner seeks to explain both the monetary origins of the Great Depression (1929-1932) and its persistence due to government-driven wage shocks (1933-1941). He credits the Mundell-Johnson hypothesis, based on the post WWI undervaluation and shortage of gold, with identifying the deflationary pressure that led to monetary distress. Sumner concludes that interest rates, money supply, and price changes provide inadequate measures of the stance of monetary policy. Sumner s most important evidence supports his arguments that, first, raising the price of gold in 1933 facilitated price inflation and rapid recovery after years of deflation; and second, that several Roosevelt-era recoveries were stopped in their tracks by New Deal-driven real wage increases. The 1937-38 depression was caused by Treasury sterilization of gold inflows, but aggravated by unionization drives and wage increases. Reviewer considers Sumner s critique of Keynesian economics, and adds overview to identify two areas where Keynes   revolution  set back understanding. He then moves to some intra-New Deal dynamics and to some recent political economy parallels.

Title:  The Third International Conference in Economics EconWorld 2016
Abstract: These are conference notes of the Third International Conference in Economics (EconWorld 2016-Barcelona). Information on the topics, impressions about the sessions and general remarks about the conference are included in this note. It was a successful academic event with broad international participation. The variety of the studies and the dynamic discussion periods were quite refreshing during the conference. Furthermore, the conference was a good occasion to get in touch with colleagues from other countries and to be reminded of several issues of economics in a compact way since conferences usually are limited to 2-3 days. Needless to say, it was a well-organized and satisfactory academic event.

Title:  Leadership and the Mandate of Heaven: Political Risk in China
Abstract:  China has experienced very impressive economic growth over the past three decades and has raised millions of people out of poverty in a short period of time. This economic miracle has brought prosperity to millions and extreme wealth to some. China now faces slower growth and a number of other obstacles which may undermine its stability. This paper explores the problems facing modern China by looking back at history and using current social science research as a predictor of potential unrest and political instability.

Title:  The Federal Reserve as Lender of Last Resort During the Subprime Crisis   Successful Stabilisation Without Structural Changes
Abstract:  This paper studies the actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) during the financial crisis from 2007-2012 rating the performance of the Federal Reserve during the crisis. The chosen scoring model approach shows that the average performance of five specific measures taken by the FRB only ranks between fair and good. Comparing Stiglitz (2010) viewpoints with those of the FRB, this paper analyses several policies and events and argues that the resulting decisions were well intentioned but that the outcome was different from expectations because of missing regulations and restrictions. Furthermore, the structure of the FRB is examined and criticized.

Title:  International Remittances and Brain Drain in Ghana
Abstract:  This paper presents a static computable general equilibrium (CGE) framework to numerically examine the impact of international remittances and the brain drain on poverty reduction as well as income inequality in Ghana. The generalized framework with the latest Ghanaian input-output table of year 2005 with 59 different production sectors provides the following results: On the impact of international remittances, more remittances reduce poverty, and expand the Ghanaian economy. On the impact on income inequality, it depends on who receives more remittances. If the rural (urban) households receive more remittances, then income inequality shrinks (widens). On the impact of the brain drain, it is negative to both poverty reduction and income inequality, even if the externality effect of the brain drain is taken into account. On the overall impact of both remittances and the brain drain in Ghana, income inequality becomes more severe. On the other hand, the overall impact on poverty reduction, it depends on the amount of remittances as well as the sector where the brain drain occurs. As long as the brain drain occurs in either the education or the health sector, then the positive impact of remittances outweighs the negative impact of the brain drain. However, if the brain drain occurs in all sectors, then the overall impact would result in the damage of Ghanaian economy. Even though the positive impact of international remittances is taken into account, the Ghanaian economy has been damaged by the brain drain, and emigration from Ghana has resulted in more income inequality and lower income.

Title:  Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Mathematical Analysis of the Historical Growth of Human Population
Abstract:  Data describing historical growth of human population, global and regional (Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, former USSR, Africa and Latin America), are analysed. Results are in harmony with the earlier analysis of the historical growth of the world population in the past 12,000 years and with other independent studies. This analysis is also in harmony with the study of the historical economic growth. Within the range of analysable data, there was no Malthusian stagnation. Takeoffs from stagnation to growth, postulated by the Unified Growth Theory never happened. There were no escapes from the Malthusian trap because there was no trap in the growth of population. This analysis and the earlier studies of the Gross Domestic Product lead to the conclusion that there were also no takeoffs in the income per capita distributions, claimed by the Unified Growth Theory. Consequently, the claimed differential timing in takeoffs never happened. Unified Growth Theory is contradicted yet again by the mathematical analysis of the same data, which were used, but never analysed, during the formulation of this theory. The study presented here, as well as earlier publications on the related topics, shows also that certain fundamental postulates used in the economic and demographic research are repeatedly contradicted by the mathematical analysis of data.

Title:  Cirebon as the Silk Road: A New Approach of Heritage Tourisme and Creative Economy
Abstract:  The tourism industry and creative economy in Cirebon can not be separated from the historical aspect of the city's growth and development as silk lines in the spread of Islam, trade, and acculturation is very smooth so that the ethnic diversification becomes a major part in tourist activities. With a qualitative approach that emphasizes the phenomenon of ethnic Cirebon with tourist objects that vary in every corner of this city, then this paper confirms that Cirebon is a tourist destination that is unique in terms of religion, culture, history, to the creative economy, especially religious tourism that will create this city as a friendly city for tourists.

Title:  Structural Features and Mechanisms of The Korean Powerhouses: What Makes These Niche Companies Leaders in The Global Market?
Abstract:  This study explores the structural features and mechanisms that allow relatively small Korean companies to secure dominant market positions in their respective business sectors. By examining five specific aspects of their operations (financing structure, financial structure, growth structure, R&D activities, and business structure), the source of these companies  unique success is better understood. Ultimately, our findings show that when these five aspects work together as a single and highly efficient  machine,  these Korean powerhouses are able to secure and maintain dominant market positions in the global market. Further, we extend the concept of Korean hidden champions based on the various results of our analysis to propose six criteria useful to redefining them as Korean powerhouses.

Title:  Modelling the Egyptian Shadow Economy: A MIMIC model and A Currency Demand approach
Abstract:  We estimate the size and trend of the Egyptian shadow economy using two of the most commonly used methods: the currency demand approach and the structural equation MIMIC model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate an index of the size of the shadow economy in Egypt during the last four decades (1976 to 2013). We address the long term association between the variables, relax the assumption of multivariate normality and demonstrate different scenarios of constraining the reference variable in the MIMIC model. In addition to the standard explanatory variables used in the literature, we consider variables that are specifically related to the Egyptian economy such as self-employment, agricultural importance and a proxy for institutional quality of democratic institutions. Our results indicate a decreasing trend of the size of the shadow economy, yet it still has a huge weight on the official GDP for a developing country like Egypt leading to some negative externalities and thus hindering the development of the country.

Title:  Automating Analytics: Forecasting Time Series in Economics and Business
Abstract:  With the growing ability of organizations in the public and private sector to collect large volumes of real-time data, the mounting pile of information presents specific challenges for storage, processing, and analysis. Many organizations do need data analysis for the purposes of planning and logistics. Likewise, governments and regulators will need analysis to support policy-making, implementation and controlling. All this leads to the importance of being able to generate large-scale analytics under (sometimes severe) resource constraints. This paper investigates a possible solution   automating analytics with a special focus on forecasting time series. Such approach has the benefit of being able to produce scalable forecasting of thousands of variables with relatively high accuracy for a short period of time and few resources. We first review the literature on time series forecasting with a particular focus on the M, M-2, and M-3 forecasting competition and outline a few major conclusions supported across different empirical studies. The paper then proceeds to explore the typical structure of a time-series variables using Bulgarian GDP growth and show how the ARIMA modeling with a seasonal component can be used to fit economic data of this class. We also review some major approaches to automating forecasting and outline the benefits of selecting the optimal model from a large set of ARIMA alternatives using an information criterion. A possible approach to fit an automated forecasting algorithm on four crucial economic time series from the Bulgarian economy is demonstrated. We use data on GDP growth, inflation, unemployment, and interest rates and fit a large number of possible models. The best ones are selected by taking recourse to the Akaike Information Criterion. The optimal ARIMA models are studied and commented. Forecast accuracy metrics are presented and a few major conclusions and possible model applications are outlined. The paper concludes with directions for further research.

Title:  A Dynamic Analysis of the Determinants of the Greek Credit Default Swaps
Abstract:  There is a consensus in finance literature that credit default swap spreads can be used to calculate the default probability of a government bond. The question is therefore what determines the credit default swap spreads and also what is a good indicator that predicts the future behaviour of this security spreads. In this paper, we investigate several variables which have been used in the past to predict the CDS spreads. We do this by analysing the behaviour of credit swaps spreads of Greek sovereign debt over the recent financial crisis. We take into account the changes on the data generating process as the crisis evolves. Moreover, we also investigate which part of the dynamic process of CDS spreads is explained by each possible determinant. In order to do so, we use a time-frequency approach. As it turns out, some determinants are better in explaining the short term behaviour of the CDS spreads whilst others explain the long term behaviour. We can also say by how many months one factor determines the behaviour of the CDS spreads for Greek sovereign debt. With this information we are able to determine the probability of default and what it depends upon.

Title:  Exchange Arrangements and Currency Crises: What s the matter with the exchange rate classification?
Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate whether certain exchange rate arrangements are more prone to currency crises using a probit model. We define a currency crisis as a period characterised by the presence of intense foreign exchange market pressure. The definition is based on a foreign exchange market pressure index (MPI). If the value of the MPI is above a certain threshold, we define that period as a crisis state; otherwise the period is defined as a tranquil state. The definition of currency crises used in this paper focuses on discrete events.

Title:  Wladimir Andreff (Ed.), Disequilibrium Sports Economics: Competitive Imbalance and Budget Constraints
Abstract:  The economics of professional team sport leagues has been built on three main pillars in the US literature: economic equilibrium for the product market and labour market for talent; profit maximisation; and competitive balance between teams (sporting equilibrium). The European literature has brought a fourth pillar: win maximisation with a hard budget constraint (break-even accounting rule). These four pillars have remained little questioned until recently. This emerging literature is one of the motivations for launching a book dealing with disequilibrium. Another is the editor s conviction that the reality in team sport leagues does not fit with general equilibrium solutions. The first chapter introduces the previous elements and more generally the book while the seven following chapters develop a specific aspect related to disequilibrium: an attempt at modelling; a dynamic non-equilibrium simulation; the metrics of competitive imbalance; gender imbalance on the sports programme market; and the last three chapters on soft budget constraints with three different focuses (comparison between European and US leagues; governance and agency problem; regulation regarding the new UEFA club licensing and Financial Fair Play). As a whole, the book provides an original and realistic view that can and perhaps even must shape the future of sports economics.

Title:  Matthew P. Drennan, Income Inequality: Why it Matters and Why Most Economicsts Didn t Notice
Abstract:  Matthew P. Drennan, Income Inequality: Why It Matters and Why Most Economists Didn t Notice (Yale University Press, 2015) deserves significant notice. The author focuses on theoretical approaches that might have shown the causes of income inequality with main attention to the theory of consumption, where the mainstream of the economics profession, after some attention earlier, turned away from inequality as a causal factor after the 1950s. He documents that turn, and suggests directions for a new theory. He gives brief mention to policy suggestions, but mainly concerns himself with causal issues on which policy would have to be based. Matthew Drennan has been a Visiting Professor of Urban Planning, Luskin School of Urban Affairs, UCLA since 2004. He is an Emeritus Professor, City and Regional Planning, Cornell University.

Title:  Theory of the Firm: A Reformulation with Primary Factors of Production and Procurement of Ingredient Inputs
Abstract:  This paper reformulates the neoclassical theory of the firm by distinguishing two types of inputs: (1) the primary factors of production (labor, capital, etc.) and (2) ingredient inputs (intermediate goods, raw materials, and services).  The production function is defined on the space of the primary factors while ingredient inputs, as required by production technologies, are procured externally from other firms. Firms maximize profits subject to the production function as well as to the ingredient input requirement functions. We analyze how the optimal level of production and the optimal employment of factor services are determined when the cost of the acquisition of ingredient inputs is counted explicitly as part of the total cost of production. The first order condition of profit maximization requires that the marginal value-added product of an employed primary factor be equal to its price, and the second order condition is stated in terms of the negative definiteness of the Hessian of the value-added function. Cost minimization requires that the marginal cost of production be equal to the sum of an incremental cost of factor services and an incremental cost of ingredient inputs that are procured. The optimum level of production and the optimal use of the primary factors both respond to changes in the prices of ingredient inputs. The paper also shows: the zero degree homogeneity of factor demand and output supply functions, the linear homogeneity of the value-added function, Shephard s lemma, the interpretation of the Lagrangian multiplier in cost minimization, the nonlinearity of the iso-cost surfaces, and the concavity of the cost function.

Title:  The Rewards and Challenges of Export-Led Strategies
Abstract:  The economic achievements of post- WWII Japan and Germany, the success of the Asian Four Tigers in the 1970s and 1980s, and the impressive growth of China, after adopting an export-led strategy in 1978, have caused many nations to view the export-ledmodel as the fastestroute to economic growth and financial stability. As a result, many governments started to promote and protect their countries  exports,and mix politics, diplomacy and trade as well as seek greater access to friendly countries  markets. Export-led development strategies, however, carry some risks, such as increased dependence on foreign markets and political forces that are beyond the exporters  control. Global market forces, at times, cause export-dependent countries to have a sudden decline in their export revenues as the oil exporting countries have been experiencing as a result of a sharp decline in the world price of crude oil since 2014. This paper examines the main benefits, costs, and risks associated with export-led strategies, particularly as adopted by developing countries. It further explores the motives and risks faced by individual companies as they sell some of their products outside their home markets.

Title:  How Efficient are the Current U.S. Beer Taxes?
Abstract:  This paper examines the status of current beer taxes in the U.S. by questioning how far away the present beer taxes are from the optimal taxes. Following the estimation of tax elasticity, I estimate the lifetime discounted costs that a heavy drinker levies on others through: 1) Years of life lost; 2) Social insurance system; 3) Drunk driving accidents; and 4) Forgone income taxes. The optimal level of beer tax ranges from 17.15 percent to 47.5 percent of the price per drink. Even the conservative estimates suggest that current beer taxes comprise only 16 percent of the external costs.

Title:  Nonlinearities in Inflation and Growth Nexus: The Case of Tanzania
Abstract:  Achieving high economic growth rate while maintaining low inflation rate, has become the main objective of monetary authorities all over the world. Indeed, empirical literature reflects that high inflation rates are detrimental to long run growth and entail welfare costs. To achieve this objective, central banks have availed different options from time to time which include inflation targeting. Monetary authorities in Tanzania have been targeting an inflation level of around 5 percent per annum for economic policy purposes. However, when high inflation is to be controlled, tight monetary policy is put in place which might in turn affect the economic activity. Also, the Tobin effect suggests that inflation causes individuals to substitute out of money and into interest earning assets, which leads to greater capital intensity which in turn promotes economic growth. Against these major points, this paper examines a non linear relationship between inflation and economic growth using both a quadratic and threshold endogenous models and attempts to identify the existence of threshold effects between these variables. The paper uses a data set spanning from 1967 to 2015. The most interesting finding of the estimations is that the estimated coefficient of the linear term of inflation is negative while the estimated coefficient of the square term of inflation is positive, suggesting a U-shaped effect as opposed to inverse or inverted U-shaped relationship found in other countries by previous studies. These results suggest that the Tobin effect may be valid for high inflation, in which people strongly realize the importance of substituting money for interest-bearing assets. This leads to an increase in capital investment, and in turn, an increase in economic growth even with high inflation rate. However, this U-shaped relationship between inflation and economic growth suggests that, the economy is better off at extremely low inflation episodes. The optimal inflation rate that ranges between 3.25 percent and 3.75 percent is obtained by minimizing the residual sum of squares and/or maximizing adjusted R-squared. These findings have some policy implications for the policymakers and development partners. The paper is consistent with policy suggestions by international agencies. Efforts to minimize inflation to a very low level are likely to have a positive effect on economic growth.

Title:  Equivalence of Cournot and Bertrand equilibria in duopoly under relative profit maximization: A general analysis
Abstract:  We study the relationship between Cournot equilibrium and Bertrand equilibrium in duopoly with differentiated goods in which each firm maximizes its relative profit. We show that Cournot equilibrium and Bertrand equilibrium coincide under relative profit maximization even with general demand and cost functions. This result is due to the fact that a game of relative profit maximization in duopoly is a two-person zero-sum game.

Title:  Testing the Efficiency of the GIPS Sovereign Debt Markets using an Asymmetrical Volatility Test
Abstract:  The efficient market hypothesis has been around since 1962, the theory is based on a simple rule, namely that the price of any asset must fully reflect all available information.Yet there is empirical evidence financial markets are too volatile to be efficient. The empirical evidence suggests that the reaction to events is the crucial factor, rather than the actual information. Generally, market participants react differently to negative and positive market shocks, hinting at asymmetrical effects. This paperanalyses the impact of asymmetrical effects on the efficiency of the financial market during the recent crises. We test the efficiency of the financial markets using the daily prices of the GIPS sovereign debts between June 2007 and December 2011. This allowed us to test the efficiency during the financial crisis and sovereign debt crisis periods. We used a GJR-GARCH based variance bound test based on the test derived by Fakhry & Richter (2015). Our tests provide evidence forfinancial markets being too volatile to be efficient. At the same time, the results are pointing towards bounded rationality rather than irrationality.

Title:  Projections of Inflation Dynamics for Pakistan: GMDH Approach
Abstract:  This study is focused on identifying, based on various forecast accuracy criteria, best inflation forecasting model for Pakistan using the in sample projections for Pakistan inflation from 2006II to 2009II. To resolve the important issue of degree of contribution in forecasting performance of the two monetary aggregates in forecasting inflation, three main predictors: real GDP, interest rate and one out of the two monetary aggregate have been used, thus constructing two models; one with Divisia Monetary Index (DMI) and other with Simple sum monetary aggregate (SSMA). It is revealed that, though both of the monetary aggregates are important predictors in forecasting inflation, but DMAs provide better fit and improved forecasts as compared to their simple sum counterpart. Hence, the evidence is established that monetary aggregates still play a dominant role in predicting inflation for Pakistan economy. The study recommends the construction, publication, and use of high frequency DMAs by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for forecasting inflation in Pakistan instead of SSMAs. Finally, to identify the improvement in forecast accuracy w.r.t. different forecasts combination, these forecasts have been combined and compared. It is revealed that when the structure of an empirically observed underlying series has complex nonlinear structure then forecasts based on single nonlinear model may fail to capture these diverse complexities. The best strategy is then to use various nonlinear models and combine these forecasts. Further the study concluded that if the complex nonlinear structure of an observed series is, a priory, unknown then universal approximators like Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)- Polynomial Neural Networks (PNNs) and GMDH-Combinatorially Optimized (CO)  could provide outstandingly accurate forecasts yet avoiding  overfitting  even for small sample size. Specifically, it recommends the use of nonlinear non-parametric universal approximators for forecasting inflation in Pakistan by the SBP.

Title:  Efficiency with Rule-Compliance: A Contribution to the Theory of the Firm in Islamic Economics
Abstract:  The theory of the firm and the profit maximization have been important areas of debate among Islamic economists as being fore bearers of applicability of conventional economic theory in the Islamic economics. One strand of the debate holds the view that the postulate of profit maximization, as a useful theoretical construct, has to be modified for a firm operating in an Islamic economy, while the other strand highlights that Islamic economy has its own normative rules with an underlying institutional scaffolding derived from the Qur an and Sunnah. Following the second view, this paper is a modest contribution to the debate by demonstrating that once an institutional scaffolding containing the rules of behavior compliant with the Qur an and Sunnah is in place, the profit maximization postulate becomes a useful concept in Islamic economic theory. The paper also shows that allocation efficiency with equity is possible provided that the firm is rule-compliant, even in case of a monopoly.

Title:  State and Governance in the Contemporary International Economic System
Abstract:  The end of the Cold War caused many changes in the world s political and economic order. Under the newly reshaped world order, debate on the role of states with regard to governance of the international economic system has reached unprecedented levels, with some scholars proclaiming the end of the state and the beginning of a new era in a borderless world, and others insisting that nothing has changed with regard to the state s role. It is obvious that, since 1991, changes in technology have greatly enhanced the volume, intensity and speed of international economic activities. In today s highly interdependent world economy, the state s power has indeed been transformed to meet the needs of changing international markets, but this transformation does not necessarily mean a diminishment in the power of the state. When an international crisis arises, neither private actors nor civil society organizations are called upon to solve the problem. The state as an actor appears to be turning to the economic scene these days through ongoing bail-out operations.

Abstract:  Robert Dirks offers an important contribution to food and nutrition history in his book Food in the Gilded Age: What Ordinary Americans Ate. The book spans a broad swath of late 19th century US nutrition history using available dietaries from diverse sources and multiple ethnic groups. Early Mexican-Americans represent one of the earliest ethnic groups in the US. During the Gilded Age, the children of Native-Mexicans with early white European explorers  Mestizos-reflectthe most pre-developed diets in the West. Dirks summarizes their diets using Mexican-American households in Las Cruces, New Mexico and the Rio Grande Valley, Texas that were transitioning into Southwestern economies.

Title:  Interpretations of Hyperbolic Growth
Abstract:  Hyperbolic growth describes the historical economic growth and historical growth of population, but their mechanism remains unexplained. Presented here is a brief survey of attempts to understand hyperbolic growth. Mathematical formulations are in general complicated and there is no clear advantage in using them because they do not give better description of data than the simple, two-parameter hyperbolic formula. They also do not explain the mechanism of growth. The well-known simple formula suggests a simple explanation. Two examples show how two independent investigations were on a brink of making an important and breakthrough discovery and how their potential discovery was thwarted by the established knowledge in demography and in economic research. Researchers who could have used their expertise to suggests new research directions and to advance science were constrained by doctrines, which are widely accepted by faith.

Title:  A Paternalist s Mistake: Rent Control
Abstract:  Rent control, to the economically uninitiated, sounds like a good idea. After all, given that poor people spend a disproportionate percentage of their incomes on housing, what policy could possibly be of more help to them than to lower their rents? Profit-seeking landlords can hardly be expected to do so on their own. Their inability to undertake so public-spirited a policy thus constitutes a  market failure,  and only government can ride to the rescue the suffering masses. This at least is the story widely told by journalists, clergy, teachers, etc. The present paper is an attempt to shed some light on the very opposite perspective: that rent controls lower the supply of residential rental housing, and thus hurt the poor, the very people supposedly helped by this unwarranted legislation.

Title:  Randomness, Determinism and Undecidability in the Economic Cycle Theory
Abstract:  The scientific literature that studies the Business cycles contains a historical debate between random and deterministic models. On the one hand, models built with explanatory variables follow a stochastic trajectory and produce, through transmission mechanisms, the studied cycles. Its rationale: the so-called Slutsky-Yule effect. In addition, models in which the system phase at time T fixes, applying the  ceteris paribus condition , the phase at time t + 1. The cycle would be the product of variables, making it possible to predict and enabling economic policies to combat recessions. The thesis of this work is as follows. The application of the theorems of Chaitin of undecidability shows that it is not possible to conclude such debate. It is impossible to determine with absolute certainty whether the observed cycles follow a deterministic or stochastic model. To reach this result, I outline the fundamental theories of the business cycle, providing a classification and examples of mathematical models. I review the definition of randomness, and I consider the demonstration of Chaitin about the impossibility of deciding whether a data set is stochastic or not. A consequence, he says, of G del incompleteness theorems. I conclude considering a string of economic data, aggregated or not, as random or deterministic, depends on the theory. This applies to all cyclical phenomena of any nature. Specific mathematical models have observable consequences. But probabilism and determinism are only heuristic programs that guide the knowledge progress.

Title:  Destination EU and USA: Improving Export Potential of Pakistan by Trading with India
Abstract:  This paper is the extension of popular work of Murshed and Mamoon(2010) that suggests that India Pakistan proximity to global trade can significantly mitigate conflict between these two nations. The paper analyses bilateral trade patterns between India Pakistan with its major exporting destinations in a simple OLS framework. It finds that if bilateral trade between two nations increases that will improve exports of Pakistan in US, EU and UAE. This finding has significant implications for improvement of ties between the two countries. Furthermore, trading with India also full fills Pakistani Government s emphasis on Trade not Aid. This aspect of India Pakistan trade has not been investigated before.

Title:  Foreign Direct Investment and Sectoral Performance in Tanzania
Abstract:  Although it may seem natural to argue that Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) can bridge the investment gap in developing countries  economy, which in turn foster economic growth, this paper shows that the effect of FDI vary greatly across sectors. In fact, there is a lack of systematic evidence on the actual impact of FDI on the host country. An empirical analysis using time series data spanning from 1970 to 2015 and applying Error Correction Mechanism, suggests that FDI exerts a negative effect on agriculture value added. Unsurprisingly, FDI tends to have a positive effect on manufacturing, construction and transport, storage and communication sectors. Evidence from the mining sector is not clear despite the fact that the sector constitutes a substantial proportion of FDI inflows. The unexpected negative causal relationship between FDI inflows and agricultural sector in Tanzania could be because of the low level of FDI in the sector relative to other sectors. However, it is possible for FDI to be contributing to the GDP through manufacturing, construction and transport, storage and communication sectors and yet not increasing the welfare of the people in the country. Agriculture sector, which constitutes more than 70 percent of the total labour force, contributes, on average, less than 30 percent, in total GDP. Understandably, FDI in the agricultural sector can improve the welfare in the country than FDI in mining and manufacturing sectors. Given the importance of the subject, it is surprising to find that very little effort has been devoted to quantifying the sources of agricultural decline.

Title:  On the Economic Returns From a Global Program of Social Capital: A Trillion Dollar Agenda for Growth
Abstract:  For the economy to grow, the actors in the marketplace need to expand the overall output rather than jostle each other for bigger shares of the available output. To this end, the productivity level may be boosted through a comprehensive program of social capital. Based on the experience of the 20th century, the rich countries of the world could afford to commit US$1 trillion per year for a couple of decades. According to a compelling scenario, the total investment of $20 trillion in nominal terms will comprise $13.6 trillion in current dollars since the funds will be disbursed over time rather than spent at once. Based on conservative estimates, the present value of the benefits will exceed $3.39 quadrillion which represents a payback of 249 times the original investment. In this way, the windfall from a global program of social capital should far surpass the outlay required for its implementation.

Title:  The Main Determinants of Private Investments in the WAEMU Zone: The Dynamic Approach
Abstract:  This article investigates the main determinants of private investment in the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). After checking for unit root and co-integration, Error Correction Model is specified, and three estimators are performed: Dynamic Fixed-Effects, Mean Group, and Pooled Mean Group. Hausman tests show that the Dynamic Fixed-Effects Estimator is more efficient and consistent than others. Results suggest that, in the short-run, private investment in the WAEMU zone is determined by the aggregate demand conditions: gross domestic product and output gap, while, in the long-run, it is determined by gross domestic product, and political stability. The short-run elasticity of gross domestic product and output gap are statistically significant and average to 5.7 and 0.06, respectively. The long-run elasticity of gross domestic product and the semi-elasticity of political stability are statistically significant and average to 2.4 and -0.25, respectively. These finds imply that, to promote private investment in the WAEMU zone, there is a need among others for more proper design and implementation of aggregate demand management policies, and political framework stability.

Title:  The Measurement of Credit Channel in the CEMAC Zone
Abstract:  This article measures the credit channel s parameters in monetary policy transmission in the CEMAC zone. Having highlighted the limitations of other channels with a theoretical and factual assessment, we check the effectiveness of bank credit channel through the autoregressive vectors  method, using consolidated monetary and macroeconomic data from six countries in the Zone, from 1960 to 2012. It appears that credit channel is narrow. It has a low outflow and a depth-based credit as far as the private sector is concerned, while the GDP reacts with a two-year period following a monetary policy impulse.

Title:  Skilled Labor Mobility in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC): Experience from Thailand Labor Market
Abstract:  Skilled labor mobility in the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) plays an important issue in labor market due to the impact of globalization, especially increasing demand for high technology and integration among region. This impact leads free movement of workers among employer in service sectors, foreign investment and need more demand for skilled labor. Moreover, AEC blueprint in 2015 outlined to moves forward to free flow of skilled labor achieve strategic goal of single market and production base. These included facilitate the issuance of visas and employment passes; mutual recognition arrangements (MRAs) for major professional service; core concordance of service skills and qualifications; and enhance cooperation among ASEAN universities to increase region mobility for student and staff. To achieve the free flow of skilled labor in AEC member countries many issue have been discussed such as the mutual recognition arrangement (MRAs) for major professional services and core competencies for job skills required in the priority integration services (PIS) sectors (ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint: 2012). The objective of the study is to determine the impact of AEC on Thai labor market by using the comparison of labor immigration in AEC member countries. The paper provides a description of (a) currently govern the cross-country labor movement within ASEAN for skilled workers: and b) the analytical framework that support the discussion in deriving the recommendations that there are already experiences on these types of worker movements. The finding of Thai labor market has found in two characteristics: shortage of professionals and technicians and unskilled and semi-skilled labor.

Title:  Artificial Intelligence and Urbanization: The Rise of the Elysium City
Abstract:  From ancient times, Greek religion introduced Elysium as a heavenly place to which admission was exclusively reserved for mortals related to gods, heroes, and those blessed by gods. We argue that the rise of artificial intelligence technology will lead to the creation of Elysium cities. Elysium cities agents will be technologists, technocrats, intelligent machines, and wealthy capitalists. These cities will be the first embracers of the artificial intelligence technology and will do so by incorporating five capabilities: physical, intellectual, information, governance, and socio-economic. As early adopters, these cities will acquire tremendous political and economic power and will turn into self-governing city-states. During the early stages of the AI revolution, these Elysium cities will shed millions of unemployed via a process we call De-tech Migration. De-tech cities will be the recipients of the labor migration from the Elysium cities and will rapidly become and remain impoverished. This article presents key policy suggestions that can be adopted by companies and governments to avoid potential decline and find new pathways towards growth and prosperity in an artificial intelligence economy.

Title:  Capital Liberalisation and Economic Instability
Abstract:  This study intends to examine the larger issues related to capital liberalisation and also to analyse the reasons for recent support of capital mobility and its repercussions for the future prospects of the economies of developing countries. The objective is to critically examine relevant empirical and theoretical studies in order to answer these questions and address the objectives of this study. The methodology adopted in this study relies on secondary information, reports and published studies to address the research questions. The study finds that following the adoption of capital liberalisation and neoliberalism, the economies of most developing countries have become more vulnerable. If China is excluded, we find that most developing economies have been unable to expand employment opportunities or reduce levels of poverty. In recent years capital liberalisation policy has encouraged capital flight from their economies.

Title:  Metropolitan Business Cycle Analysis for Lubbock
Abstract:  This study develops a business cycle index (BCI) for Lubbock Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). The Stock & Watson (1989; 1991; 1993) methodology is used to develop the BCI and assumes that the co-movements of key economic indicators have a single underlying, unobservable factor. This factor is extracted from the indicators and used to calculate an index that represents economic conditions through an econometric approach.  The model uses the Kalman filter smoothing approach which smooths across variables and over time. This results in an index that is smoother with less pronounced expansions and recessions. Indicator series used for the study are: establishment employment, unemployment, real retail sales and real wages that begin in 1990 and include complete data through the end of 2015. Results indicate that the Lubbock business cycle has peaks and troughs that occur later than those for the national economy.

Title:  Analysis of Asymmetries in the Tax-Spending Nexus in Burundi
Abstract:  This study examines the asymmetries in the tax-spending nexus for Burundi using a three-variable model. The study employs a threshold cointegration test with asymmetric adjustment advanced by Enders & Siklos (2001). The findings indicate that government spending, taxes and grants are cointegrated with asymmetric adjustment. Causality tests from the estimated asymmetric error correction model suggest that in the short run there is an independent relationship between government spending and taxes in Burundi. Pertaining to the impact of grants, the results show that grants encourage the government of Burundi to spend more, but, conversely, they also discourage tax revenue, which is known as the tax displacement hypothesis. The findings further show that only government spending responds to budgetary disequilibrium, and this occurs when the budget situation is worsening. This implies that in Burundi, to restore the equilibrium when the budget situation is worsening, the adjustment is made by reducing spending. A policy intuition arising from this study is that, to reduce budget deficits, Burundi should reduce its grant-dependence and improve its tax collection system as well as cut its spending in sectors where it is not productive and reallocate it to more productive sectors.

Title:  Oil Price and Real GDP Growth of Ecuador: A Vector Autoregressive Approach
Abstract:  Ecuador is an oil exporter country but it is also an importer of oil derivatives products, in this research the relationship between the world average price of oil and the GDP per capital of Ecuador is studied, taking annual data of both from 1980 to 2015 and using the methodology of Vector Autoregressive (VAR), it is concluded according to the Impulse Response Function that a positive shock on the price of oil affects positively the GDP growth of Ecuador for 2 unit times and then returns to its natural state later. This must be explained because Ecuador is a net exporter of oil, the VAR model showed itself stable, in addition it was demonstrated that there is a causal relationship of GDP to the Price according to methodology of Toda-Yamamoto.

Title:  An Employer of Last Resort Scheme which Resembles a Free Labour Market
Abstract:  The idea that government should act as employer of last resort (ELR) is an old one. That idea is often referred to nowadays as  job guarantee . Many ELR schemes to date have been confined to the public sector. There is no good reason for that limitation: i.e. the private sector should use ELR labour as well.  A second common characteristic of ELR schemes has been that (like the WPA in the US in the 1930s) they involve specially set up projects or schemes as distinct from subsidising temporary employees into work with EXISTING employers. The  existing employer  option is preferable. Once those two common defects in ELR are removed, the result is a system where the unemployed are subsidised into temporary and relatively unproductive jobs with existing employers till better jobs appear. And that in turn is what the unemployed tend to do in a totally free market: a scenario where there are no minimum wage laws and unemployment benefit, and where the unemployed tend to get temporary low paid jobs in both public and private sectors pending the appearance of better jobs. In contrast to a free market, under ELR, take home pay is maintained at socially acceptable levels. Assuming that free markets maximise GDP, it follows that the sort of ELR system advocated here will also maximize GDP. That free market style ELR system actually resembles the ELR system that the UK has at the time of writing, namely the Work Programme. The latter  free market  / Work Programme system is not free of faults, but as long as ELR employees do not displace regular employees to too great an extent, that  free market  ELR system is better than traditional ELR.

Title:  Optimal Equilibrium State in Two-Sector Growth Model
Abstract:  The paper studies a two-sector growth model for two cases: with flexible technology and with fixed coefficients. Different states of economic equilibrium (steady states) are compared. We find that the price of investment goods with respect to the price of consumer goods should be changed if the equilibrium state has shifted. Therefore, the aggregate production function cannot be considered as a purely technical. We assume that the income distribution is determined by the direct proportionality between the profits and the investment. Then the resulting function of aggregate output is continuous and differentiable in the domain of definition, even if the technology is fixed. In the last case the function has diminishing returns of capital under Uzawa capital-intensity condition; the state of economic equilibrium is stable only when this condition is valid. We suggest that the optimal is an equilibrium state that maximizes the total profit. The model with fixed coefficients predicts the possible existence of such an optimum.

Title:  Employment Generation among Women in NREGS: A Synthesis on the basis of Micro Level Field Investigation
Abstract:  Government of India has initiated the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) or N REGS in 2006 where the basic objective is to provide 100 full man-days of employment to each willing rural household. The adjoining act (NREG Act of 2005) that guarantees employment of every rural household for 100 days has different provisions to incentivize participation of women in the programme. The programme indeed has both direct and indirect aspects towards favoring the participation of women in order to fulfill a larger objective of women empowerment. Thus it becomes imperative to focus on the extent to which the programme is inclusive of women. Official data suggest that 47% of all NREGS workers are women. However, in this regard, there is substantial variation not only across states but also across different regions within a state. The present paper based on a primary survey made in Birbhum district of West Bengal, attempts to investigate whether expansion of NREGS has been able to help the female job-card holders to get employment through NREGS where we have considered ratio of female man days to total man days of a household as the outcome variable. It is observed that the heterogeneity in the value of the stated outcome variable is significantly caused by nature of works the female job card holders have to carry out under NREGS and family parameters faced by them which somehow emanate from socio-cultural factor(s) in general and binding in particular. Apart from this, although there is inevitability of the influence of total number of NREGS man- days received in the entire reference period by the household to which the female member(s) belongs, yet, there seems no one to one correspondence between the outcome variable and the same.

Title:  Igglesis Nikos, The Revolution of Grexit: The Plan
Abstract:  On July 5, 2015, Greece held a referendum for deciding on the blackmailing proposal submitted by the Institutions of the Eurogroup on 25th of June 2015. On the threshold of the credit suffocation, the Greek people did not relent and they expressed through their vote (a percentage of 61, 31% and 3.558.450 votes) their objection; one more  NO  in their history, similar to this of 28th October of 1940. However, the Greek leaders flinched to express this  NO  using tangible policies even if the short term consequences would be painful. Instead, the foreign partners, allies and friends to Greece  which belongs to the West , still follow a strict austerity policy which has resulted in poverty of the majority of the Greek people, and in the stagflation. Igglesis Nikos, in his book  The Revolution of GREXIT: The Plan , makes an attempt to present in a detailed way what the Greek people decided an alternative and sustainable solution.

Title:  Trade, Growth and Economic Inequality in the Asia-Pacific Region: Lessons for Policymakers
Abstract:  This policy brief is intended to provide policymakers with a summary of the results of our research project entitled  Trade, Growth and Economic Inequality in the Asia-Pacific Region , which explores and documents the linkages between international trade and inequality in the Asia-Pacific Region (APR).The project s eleven research papers appeared in a special issue of the Journal of Asian Economics in February 2017. Overall, we conclude that the relationships between international trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth and inequality are extremely complicated, so no single theory should be relied upon for policy guidance across all APR countries with their varying stages of development and unique characteristics. Our studies find some evidence that trade or FDI contribute to inequality, some evidence that it reduces inequality and some evidence of no causal relationship. These seemingly conflicting results are not at all surprising given the complex relationships involved and the different countries, time periods, and means of measuring inequality, trade and FDI our authors adopted. Our main takeaway for policymakers is to be wary of both anti-trade and pro-trade advocates who provide  one size fits all  advice related to trade, FDI and inequality; these economic relationships are much too complex for that.

Title:  Economic and Political Cooperation between India and East Asia: The Emerging Perspective
Abstract:  After initiating the economic liberalization policies in 1991, India adopted a  Look East Policy  (LEP) with the dual objective of securing economic growth and maintaining maritime security. Cooperation with East Asia received further boost, when the  Act East Policy  (AEP) came into effect during the maiden visit of Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi at the ASEAN-India Summit in 2014, which emphasizes on practicing more action-oriented policy towards ASEAN and the wider East Asia. As a result of the policy shift and through the other initiatives like Make-in-India, India s trade and investment linkages with East Asia is on the rise. In 2015, the Prime Minister visited five East Asian countries at various occasions. There have been other high level diplomatic visits to the East, followed by the appropriate diplomatic channels. Therefore, AEP has brought a great sense of speed and priority in engaging with the East and Southeast Asian countries. On maritime front, China s nine-dash line doctrine generated strategic concerns both in East and Southeast Asia and India has emerged as a strategic player in the region through joint naval exercises and capacity buildings with partner countries. Given the recent reservations expressed by Beijing against the ruling by the international tribunal in The Hague, India s maritime security initiatives in East Asia is likely stay relevant in coming days. The current paper examines the future for India-East Asia relations in days to come, especially in the current geo-political set-up.

Title:  A Small Scale Macroeconomic Model for Morocco
Abstract:  In this research paper, we build a New Keynesian reduced-form macroeconomic model for Morocco. The model encompasses three main blocks: an aggregate demand equation (IS curve), a price-setting equation (Phillips curve) and a Taylor-type monetary policy rule. In our model, we consider a significant forward-looking component when explaining inflation dynamics, which enables us to include agent s expectations. The downstream aim of this work is to provide the research community with new possibilities in terms of economic workhorse modelling, particularly for monetary policy analysis purposes.

Title:  Patterns and Micro-Drivers of International Emigration in Nigeria
Abstract:  The study attempts to unfold the determinants of international migration from Nigeria to other countries by using 2009 Nigeria Migration Survey data by World Bank (2011). It also employs econometric techniques of linear probability and binary probit models. The findings indicates that individual and household characteristics as well as economic and geographical factors play significant roles in making Nigerians to migrate abroad. The individual characteristics are gender (if male), age, marital status and education years, while household size is the only significant factor under household characteristics. The amount of remittance is the only significant economic determinant. The statistically significant geographical factors include locality (if urban) and geopolitical zones (if south-east, south-south, south-west and Lagos). Second, the same factors are the determinants of international migration to OECD and African countries, albeit they are stronger in influencing migration to African countries than to OECD countries. However, amount of remittance has positive effect on international migration to OECD countries but it is negative on international migration to African countries. Thus, the policy implication is that any international migration policy should target the above determinants of international migration in order to contain it.

Title:  Will Secular Stagnation be the Result of Great Recession
Abstract:  While Keynesian and neo-liberal discussions on the reasons of and solutions to the last financial crisis have persisted to the present day, new argument from Lawrence Summers and Paul Krugman in late 2013 shifted the debate to the issue of secular stagnation. Opposed to the neo-liberal haplessness regarding a parsimonious analysis of the events of recent years in global economy, Keynesians argued that falling private investment across the advanced economies was the most alarming development that can pave the way for secular stagnation. In this paper, after looking at the main tenets of the above mentioned discussion we will contest the explanations of both strands of political economy, at the same time we will suggest that critical Marxist arguments, especially on falling rate of profit, have been increasingly relevant to this discussion.

Title:  The Effect of Public Sector Development Expenditures and Investment on Economic Growth: Evidence from Pakistan
Abstract:  It is an established fact that there is strong association between investment and economic growth of a country but no such direct consensus had been developed on the type of investment. i.e. what are the different sectors in which investment has led to long term impact and did contributed to the growth. The current study in this regard will focus on investigating the relationship of Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Private Investment with the growth. The study will use data from 1980-81 to 2015-16 in this regard and employ Johansen cointegration to investigate the long run relationship. It is found that with foreign direct investment, health expenditure and transport and communication expenditure has negative relationship in the long run. Where as private investment, education expenditure and expenditure on housing has positive relationship with growth. Based on these findings recommendations were totally investment centric with primary focus on reduction in taxes and other barriers to bring in more investment in long run. Beside taxation, recommendations were made on administrative balance both in tax system and public sectors which were made part of provincial domain after 18th amendment.

Title:  Capability Approach: A Formal Introduction
Abstract:  The capability approach has been made operable and an example is the Human Development Index and the Multidimensional Poverty Index (Dotter & Klasen, 2014). However, its operable nature in the field of evaluation of specific dimension such as education, gender and poverty from a diffuse perspective is even broader (Addabbo, Di Tommaso & Facchinetti, 2004; Martinetti, 2006; Addabbo & Facchinetti, 2013). In this sense, this article aims to provide a very brief formal aproximation to the capability approach, mainly focusing on some their fundamental concepts.

Title:  Is rising income inequality far from inevitable during structural transformation? A proposal for an augmented inequality dynamics
Abstract:  This paper examines whether rising income inequality is the stylised fact for the process of structural transformation by revisiting classical accounts on the transformation-inequality nexus, with a particular focus on Kuznets s and Rostow s theories of development and Rawls s difference principle. In addition, a complex interaction between structural transformation and income inequality is analysed by exploring the multi-dimensions of inequality dynamics to link Kuznets-Rostow-Rawls. This critical review allows us to conclude that rising income inequality is far from inevitable by introducing a proposal for what it calls  augmented inequality dynamics  which attempts to systematize circulating societal processes through social, economic, political and moral dimensions. This explains how income inequality is used to incentivise or restrain the process of various societal interactions by itself going up and down repeatedly in the context of structural transformation.

Title:  Any given season?
Abstract:  An econometric analysis of the 2016 National Football League season is conducted with respect to regular season victories. Results obtained confirm many of the hypotheses made and bear much in common with one prior NFL study and several earlier MLB econometric analyses. Most of the data employed are fairly symmetric with relatively small standard deviations. Estimation results validate the importance of both defense and offense. Evidence is obtained that indicates that passing games are more important on offense, while shutting down the run matters most on defense. Beyond that, the regression equations also provide some insight to how human capital and payroll expenditures affect NFL regular season performances. The magnitudes of some coefficients and elasticities indicate that further analysis involving more explanatory variables can potentially provide additional clarity about what helps determine success in the NFL.

Title:  The effect of preferential tariffs of the EU: Some evidence from B&H
Abstract:  The process of trade liberalization is more or less accompanied by a reduction or elimination of tariffs. In this sense, the preferential tariffs for foreign exporters aim to increase trade flows, ensure access to foreign markets and achieve social welfare. Namely, both before and after the signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement in 2000, Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) realized some benefits from the reduction of preferential tariffs of the EU which aimed to ease the access of B&H products to the EU market. Accordingly, the question arises to what extent the preferential tariffs of the EU may lead to an increase in exports of products from the six leading sectors of B&H, observed on the basis of the volume of exports. In order to assess the effect of the preferential tariffs on the export of six leading sector of B&H, we applied the gravity equation, aggregate data on an annual basis from 1995 to 2015, and some econometric techniques, such as pooled OLS, fixed effects, random effects and dynamic panel GMM. The results of the coefficients have shown that the average preferential tariffs are significant, i.e. that have a positive effect on the overall exports. On the other hand, the results of the coefficient estimates of the average preferential tariffs on the individual export of six leading sectors have shown a significant effect in the case of half the sectors.

Title:  Quantifying the trade effects of NTMs: A review of the empirical literature
Abstract:   In recent years, the imposition of Non-Tariff Measures (NTMs) has increased rapidly both in quantity and importance. This development, with its considerable economic impact, particularly within the area of global trade, has prompted numerous scholars to explore the direction and magnitude of the trade effects of NTMs. Moreover, increased efforts are being placed on further exploring the determinants behind the use of NTMs, as well as their policy implications. The current paper aims to survey the empirical trade literature, in order to uncover the available responses to major questions regarding the trade effects of NTMs, principally of TBT and SPS measures. Among these questions posed are: (1) How do specific types of NTMs affect imports and exports? (2) Are developing countries more sensitive to NTMs? (3) Are small-medium sized firms more adversely affected by NTMs? (4) How are particular sectors/products affected by NTMs? And (5) Do Harmonization and Mutual Recognition necessarily impact trade positively?

Title:  The nexus between size and efficacy of government: evidence from OPEC
Abstract:  From classic to modern economic theories, the scope and size of government in economy have been always main topics for economists. The governments have played different roles in a historical context. Provision of public goods is a generally accepted task for all governments. The supply of public goods requires efficient allocation and management of scarce resources. Government efficacy stems from good governance and proper planning and policy-making. This paper aims to bridge from government size to government efficacy the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). To this end, a panel data in the model is estimated during 2002-2015 by using some control variables. Findings indicate a negative relationship between government size and efficacy. In addition, oil rents affect government efficacy negatively. The trade openness result in efficient government. Finally, economic growth has positive effect on result in government effectiveness. According to findings, minimization of government size, injection of oil revenues into Sovereign National Funds (SNFs), adoption of open door policies, and targeting sustainable economic growth give rise to an efficient government.

Title:  On the effects of repeated tax amnesties
Abstract:  We examine empirically the effect of tax amnesties on long term tax collection when such amnesties are used by a government as a regular source of revenue. We use data from the Tucuman province (Argentina) to test the main hypothesis of the model, namely, that amnesties lower the government s revenue, as they reduce the penalties and make evasion more profitable. We find, however, that amnesties do not affect the long-term revenue. The other main result is in line with the theoretical predictions: the increase in short-run revenue is temporary and only accelerates the collection of the taxes but does not increase the amount collected. Thus, we conclude that amnesties were used only to obtain a short-run surge in revenue and to avoid more fundamental tax reforms.

Title:  Process capital of Mongolia: Year 2005-2014
Abstract:  The purpose of this study is to explore and explain what the process capital of Mongolia is, and its national wealth that affect and being affected by national competitive advantage. Using secondary data from worldwide sources in the last 10 years, process capital at national level of analysis was analyzed. Mongolians try to use the limited capital of mining first, but they need to develop knowledge about the more structural part of this nation s capital framework just to assist industry of limited resources. We propose that this is an important part for business decision-making of policy generation that can be a reference for foreign investors.

Title:  National rural employment guarantee programme and marginal farmer households: An assessment
Abstract:  An important objective of National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (NREGP) is to create durable community asset and private asset which can enhance agricultural production as well profitability of the farmers through increasing their Gross Cropped area. It can also help the farm households to generate few extra incomes through seeking employment in this programme. An investigation is here done to evaluate the impact of this programme on marginal farmer households of West Bengal. On the basis of difference-in-difference method, it has shown that rapid expansion of NREGP indicates more asset creation in a village economy which becomes helpful for the marginal farmer households to enhance their net farm income and overall income.

Title:  Becoming a world power: The role of infrastructure alliances
Abstract:  Hegemony is a struggle for influence. The leadership of a country respect to the power of capital is deeply related to the characteristics of the political economy of the leading state and its alliances. The prevalence of the economic character of international alliances has set a scenario where a country's power in the global economy might be perceived regarding the geographic spread of its international operations. In this work, we affirm that Chinese NOCs are a fundamental tool of the PRC s geoeconomic strategy, that China s geoeconomic strategy have resulted in infrastructure alliances and that those alliances have changed the way we understand the PRC s geoeconomic and geopolitical influence in the world.

Title:  Public revenue, fiscal deficit and economic growth: Evidence from Asian countries
Abstract:  This paper examines the impact of public revenue and fiscal deficit on economic growth in 20 Asian Countries. We use panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag Model (ARDL) to estimate both the short-run and long-run impact of the fiscal variables. The results indicate that fiscal deficit adversely affect growth both in short-run and long-run. In the long-run, deficit finance leads to debt accumulation which is also negatively associated with growth. However, panel ARDL results show that revenue is positively associated with growth in the long-run. In absence of fiscal deficit, public revenue influences positively on growth in the long-run. The impact of revenue in the short-run is not significant. The findings have important policy implication in fiscal sector reform. As the developing countries in Asia are more dependent on fiscal deficit, special care has to be taken in raising public revenue to ensure desirable results. The research suggests that in the case of Asian countries where revenue level is already low and deficit is persistent, raising revenue would reduce the debt level, contributing to higher growth.

Title:  Financial gradualism and banking crises in North Africa region: an investigation by a panel logit model
Abstract:  In order to overcome the troubles of the crisis in the seventies, North African countries have adopted financial liberalization policies to enhance their economic growth. Moreover, these policies have affected the stability of their banking systems. The purpose of this study is to test the impact of financial liberalization on the probability of appearance of banking crises which covers a sample of four countries of the North Africa region during the period 1970-2003 by using a panel logit model. The empirical analysis of this study suggests that (a) the degree of financial liberalization impact significantly the occurrence of banking crises in the countries of the region, (b) the order of financial liberalization between internal and external financial liberalization is also crucial for the emergence of banking crises

Title:  Migration-driven women s empowerment: The case of Turkey
Abstract:  This paper addresses the effect of migration on women s empowerment in Turkey.  Utilization of data over six decades from 1960 until 2011 gives the possibility that these series can be spuriously correlated. This study, therefore, adopts the bounds testing procedure as a method to determine and to avoid spurious correlation. The results of bounds testing gives clear-cut evidence that women s empowerment, the share of women in parliament in the present context, is related to the emigration rate, the relative education of women and to a measure of democracy. It is also found that the share of women in parliament is related to the country groups with the largest effect in European and core OECD countries. The results are robust for the inclusion of asylum seekers and refugees in the emigration data.

Title:  Markup estimate of industrial branches in Morocco
Abstract:  In this paper, we will present an estimate of the intensity of competition in the different branches of the Moroccan industrial sector, in order to identify the branches that will be the subject of pro-competitive structural reforms, with the aim of strengthening the economic activity and job creation. For each industry, the intensity of competition is evaluated using the estimated margin factor (or markup) estimated from the method proposed by Roeger (1995). The econometric results obtained show that the relatively high margin factor in the "agrifood" and "chemical and parachemical" branches suggests that these industries are not very competitive over the 1985-2015 period.  On the other hand, the branches of "mechanical, metallic and electrical" and "extractive" industries that have significantly lower markup rates compared to other industries appear to be more competitive. The estimate of margin factors over different periods will allow us to assess the evolution over time of the degree of competition in each of the branches studied. Thus, the estimate of markup rates during the period 1985-1999 remains unclear (the margin factor is significantly lower than 1), hence we need additional information to determine the degree of concentration of industrial branches. For the period 2000-2015, the "extractive", "chemical and parachemical" and "agro-food" branches are less competitive, while the "mechanical, metal and electrical" industries appear to be more competitive.

Title:  Human capital and its impact on employment quality: Sector and wage
Abstract:  This study analyzes the relationship between human capital, employment sector and wages in Morocco. We first analyzed the role of human capital in the explanation of employment sector; then, we estimated the impact of human capital on the probability of receiving a high salary; while controlling a range of socio-economic factors. As measures of human capital, we have included the level of diploma, the field of study and the language of study. In order to achieve the aim of the research, a coherent methodology has been adopted. We exploited primary survey data. It covers 98 graduates from the Faculty of Law, Economics and Social Sciences of Tangier   Morocco, that were contacted in 2015, after three years of graduation. The main conclusion of The multinomial logistic regression models is that the Master's level graduates (five years of higher education) are more likely to be in a protected sector and to have a high salary than licensee s level graduates (three years of higher education).

Title:  What drives housing consumption in China? Based on a dynamic optimal general equilibrium model and spatial panel data analysis
Abstract:  This paper examines the housing sales in China from 2004 to 2015 utilizing an optimal dynamic general equilibrium theoretical framework combined with a macroeconomic model. The spatial panel econometric empirical results suggest that housing prices and economic growth have increased housing sales in China. However, since house is considered as a special commodity in China, and unemployment show negative impacts on housing sales.

Title:  Supply-side economics and the 2017 Tax Act
Abstract:  Several of the designers of the 2017 Tax Act were prominent as  supply side? advocates at the time of Reagan tax cuts during the 1980s. The economic argument for supply side tax rate reductions drew on a policy mix framework developed by Robert Mundell as early as 1962. Within that framework, the easy fiscal/ tight monetary policy solution was intended for circumstances of either pressure on reserves or the exchange rate (as during the Kennedy Administration) or of serious domestic inflation (as under the Carter and Reagan Administrations). Tax cuts in the US since the 1980s have not had the intended stimulus effects because neither the currency weakness nor inflationary preconditions have existed. Absent such conditions, tax rate reductions will generate either domestic over-heating or a redistribution of income to those in higher brackets. Any argument in favor of the 2017 Tax Act should not fall back on Mundell s policy mix advocacy. In contrast, the case for an easy fiscal/ tight money policy may have unexpected force in situations of fixed exchange rates, or where domestic monetary policy options are otherwise constrained or absent   as in Eurozone periphery countries.

Title:  A monetary conditions index and its application on Tunisian economic forecasting
Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to find out the extent of the influence of internal and external monetary conditions on Tunisian macroeconomic aggregates by constructing a synthetic index. We seek to contribute to the empirical literature in the following ways. First, we calculate the weights assigned to domestic interest rate and the exchange rate based on the estimated coefficients respectively for these two dimensions over the period 1965-2015. Second, by employing a VAR model approach, we confirm the long-run dynamic between the considered variables. The analysis of shocks indicates that monetary conditions have a particular importance through their effects on economic activity and inflation. The latter is characterized by its significant negative influence on economic growth and by its contribution in linking between internal and external interest rates. Third, we use a SVAR model approach for analyzing the short-run structural dynamics between the variables. Our findings reveal that the Tunisian economy is significantly influenced by external monetary conditions. This extensive influence is confirmed through the dynamics of structural monetary policy shocks and exchange rate. Overall, our study finds that the exchange rate plays an increasing role in transmitting the monetary policy effect to the inflation rate and thus the real economy.

Title:  An empirical analysis of Diaspora bonds
Abstract:  This study is the first to investigate theoretically and empirically the determinants of Diaspora Bonds for eight developing countries (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Lebanon, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Sri-Lanka) and one developed country - Israel for the period 1951 and 2008. Empirical results are consistent with the predictions of the theoretical model. The most robust variables are the closeness indicator and the sovereign rating, both on the demand-side. The spread is not significant, suggesting Diaspora Bonds differ from normal investments. Good governance and wars are also important demand-side determinants of Diaspora Bonds. Among the supply-side factors; FDI, ODA, foreign exchange, inflation, external debt and remittances significantly determine the issue of Diaspora Bonds. Most importantly, this study is able to make predictions of the most promising candidate countries in issuing Diaspora Bonds in the future.

Title:  Policy review: Is inequality a policy choice?
Abstract:  The paper is a short literature review that suggests that trade policy as opposed to general measures of openness does correlate with inequality. The review suggests that developing countries are not ready to fully integrate with global trade because significant segments of populations are unskilled whereas global trade patterns benefit only skilled or semi-skilled.

Title:  The relation between terrorism and high population growth
Abstract:  A fundamental problem in socioeconomic sciences is how to explain the root causes of terrorism. The literature has analyzed several determinants of terrorism. However, the precise role of demographic factors for the origin and evolution of terrorism in specific geoeconomic areas is hardly known. Results here show that high population growth seems to be basic for the source and evolution of terrorism. This study found that terrorism thrives, in average, in specific cultural zones with high growth rates of population combined with collective identity factors and low socioeconomic development. Overall, then, the main aim of this study is to clarify and generalize whenever possible, the demographic source of the terrorism and suggest appropriate socioeconomic policies to preempt this critical problem in society over the long run.

Title:  Did Harvard barometers allow for the prediction of the 1929 Stock market crash?
Abstract:  The Harvard barometers were an attempt to analyse and predict the business cycles, which took place in the 1920s. An initiative from the Harvard Economic Service (HES), it was one of the first and more important instrument used to try to understand the sequence in the economic fluctuations. This paper reconsiders the accepted position about the Harvard barometers, that using them it was impossible to predict the 1929 Depression. I arrive at a different conclusion. Based on the data from the ABC curves in August 1929, and with an available econometric methodology at that time, it would have been possible to forecast the fall in speculation, as defined in the curve A, whereas the fall in business (B), and in monetary and credit conditions (C) were unpredictable. The stock market crash could have been anticipated. The HES stated that curve A precedes B, and then C. This is not detected. This paper makes use of the harmonic analysis by breaking down series in sinusoidal curves. Taking into account this prediction, this work analyses if aggregation was the factor producing the perceived regularities. The conclusion is negative: aggregation did not produce those cycles, they were in the original data.

Title:  The fiscal policy impact to the Greek economy: Asymmetric evidence from a switching regime approach
Abstract:  This paper empirically investigates the magnitude of general government expenditures and tax income revenues to the Greek output within a regime-switching framework during the period 2000:1   2016:3. This nonlinear methodology captures the fiscal effects across periods of high and low growth. In more deep analysis, we examine the relationship of expenditures and GDP over time, by adopting the GARCH(1,1)-DCC methodology. Our results show that the magnitude of general government expenditures is larger during periods of low growth or economic recession, as well as the magnitude of tax income revenues. Furthermore, during the  bailout  period (2010-2016) when the fiscal adjustment was strict, GDP seem to be even stronger negatively affected by the reduction of government expenditures.

Title: Analysis of the  Dutch Disease  effect and public financial management in Mongolian economy
Abstract: This paper aims to diagnose the Mongolian economy for evidence of the  Dutch Disease  by applying a vector auto-regression model for the period 1993 2016 under the current market-based regime including resource-booming times. The results indicate a strong possibility that the Mongolian economy has been suffering from Dutch Disease through resource movement and spending effects: the mining boom crowds out manufacturing and fails to contribute to capital accumulation facilitating diversification. Policy implications for Mongolian public financial management suggest using part of the resource fund for public investment in education, health and infrastructure to promote industrial diversification.

Title: Governance over economics: Making globalisation good for the poor
Abstract: The paper employs different definitions of inequality/ equality and investigates how globalisation is associated with these welfare measures. The nations  proximity to post modernism development culture through international cooperation may enable countries to strengthen their social, economic, legal and political institutions. We find that adopting well developed institutional governance practices as a matter of greater integration with modern 21st century governance culture creates thriving middle classes in developing countries enabling a downward pressure on inequality of incomes and wages. In contrast, integration of goods and services with world markets puts upward pressure on the wages of skilled in contrast with the unskilled causing industrial wage inequalities in both developed and developing countries. The paper recommends in line with the recent literature on premature de-industrialisation phenomenon that countries may protect their local industries to provide jobs to locals and thus enable the gains of trade to be more equally distributed among the populations. This can be done by choosing the second best option towards global integration and that is to promote regionalism within geographical clusters. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Title: Examining the relationship between rent and political expenditure: Using rent information obtained from financial statements  
Abstract: This study aims to develop a standard method for measuring the rent of an individual enterprise from its financial statement data and to analyze the relationship between rents of companies and their political and R&D expenditures. A method is developed to measure monopoly and monopsony rents using mark-up rates under monopolistic equilibrium and competitive equilibrium. Using time-series financial statement data of Japanese industries, the average rents were calculated for 29 industries over 30 years. These rents were then regressed against political and R&D expenditures of industries. The results show that political expenditure is significantly related to rent, whereas R&D expenditure is not.

Title: Artificial nighttime lights and the  real  well-being of nations:  Measuring economic growth from outer space  and welfare from right here on Earth
Abstract: GDP remains too much of an imprecise measure of the standard of living. There is a need for either substitutes or complements. Nighttime lights are a reasonable indicator of the extent, scale, and intensity of socio-economic activities, but a poor measure of national welfare. However, if nighttime lights are understood to constitute externalities, then their effects can be used to adjust measured growth for welfare. From that angle, nighttime lights appear to exert sub-optimal positive externalities in developing countries, and supra-optimal negative externality in developed countries. This means that even if we assume equal growth rates in developing and developed countries, welfare is enhanced by increasing nighttime lights in developing countries and reduced by increasing nighttime lights in developed countries.

Title: The impact of human capital on the employment quality of young graduates: Case of the Faculty of Economics of Tangier
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between human capital and employment quality among young graduates from the Faculty of Economics of Tangier, Morocco. Using primary survey data collected from 150 graduates three years after their graduation, we analyze how educational level, field of study, and language skills influence employment sector selection and wage levels. The research employs multinomial logistic regression models to assess the probability of entering protected versus unprotected employment sectors and to evaluate determinants of higher wages. Results indicate that graduates with master's degrees have significantly higher probabilities of securing protected sector employment and achieving higher wages compared to bachelor's degree holders. The study provides insights for educational policy and labor market integration strategies.

Title: Substitution elasticities in an energy-augmented CES production function: An empirical analysis for Turkey  
Abstract: This study estimates a production function for Turkey taking capital, labour and energy as input factors. The production function estimated is of the CES form with Hicks-neutral technology and constant returns to scale. A nonlinear least squares regression is employed on a dataset for the entire Turkish economy covering a time period of 27 years. The production function parameters provide insights into the elasticity of substitution of capital, labour and energy in Turkey. In particular, it is found that the elasticity of substitution between the capital-labour bundle and energy is 0.645, slightly higher than values found in other studies for various countries.

Title: Study on the theoretical framework of monopoly capital school and its comparison with Minsky theory  
Abstract: Global financial crisis which broke out in 2008 triggered the great recession of the global economy, making the non-mainstream Monopoly Capital School of economics rise to fame. The mainstream economics attributed the crisis to the different external shocks and policy errors. On the contrary, Monopoly Capital School focused on the process of capital accumulation under the stage of monopoly capitalism, and offered perspective on inherent instability defects of capitalism. Based on teasing out the theoretical framework of Monopoly Capital School, this paper analyzed the standpoints, views and methods of monopoly capitalism through comparing the theory with Minsky theory, not only contributing to the understanding the instability defects of capitalism, but also contributing to the thinking of the future direction of capitalism.

Title: Imperialism and global inequality: A critical analysis  
Abstract: The article intends to analyse economic changes between advance and less-developed countries and the issues of catching up. Our approach would be to analyse the evolution of developing countries (less-developed) in the world economy in a historical perspective. The important question for 21st century is whether the regions in Asia, Africa and Latin America would be able to catch or not? To answer this we need an understanding of both economics and history, which seems to be critical for a fuller picture on this issue. There have been on-going discussions about a sharp contrast in the international distribution of wealth between the rich (industrialised) and poor (primary producing) countries and it has been emphasised that the benefit of technical progress in the advanced economies would trickle down to the poor countries. The study finds that during the last three decades, there have been huge economic changes taking place globally and structural changes and patterns of trade have also taken place both in advance and developing countries. However, some developing countries have achieved faster growth rates than the advanced economies, particularly China, India, Indonesia and Turkey. However, they constitute a small number among the developing countries, but account large number of its population. The study concludes that most poor countries have not been able to converge, while largely the two largest ones, namely China and India have experienced rapid growth rates and economic changes in recent decades.

Title: Advanced studies in economics
Abstract: Researchers have a long-standing interest in understanding the causes and consequences of inequality. One approach to analyzing inequality is to compare average economic choices from a classical theoretical framework. Another approach considers the impact of the formation of society, through statutes and institutions, on average economic outcomes. Curtis Jr uses applied econometrics, applied labor economics, applied theory and empirical data to provide results that we cannot reject the existence of a negatively bounded correlation between the duration of time from zero wage labor constraints and the magnitude of unexplained differences in wealth. Furthermore, Curtis Jr promotes a concept of entrepreneurial education in economics.

Title: International trade effects of a potentially revived Trans-Pacific partnership for North America  
Abstract: This paper analyzes the international trade relations of the United States, Canada, and Mexico with the now defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP12) member countries currently and historically in order to provide insights for potential future effects provided United States decides to join the new Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP or TPP11) with the remaining original TPP countries. Using a gravity model estimation, we find that the existing free trade agreements (FTAs) between TPP12 countries (intra-TPP) and FTAs between TPP12 members and other countries (extra-TPP) have positively impacted trade in the 1980-2015 period. A revived TPP12 agreement promises to boost trade further.

Title: Do fiscal measures stimulate private investment in Africa?  
Abstract: The study inspects the effect of fiscal measures on private investment in selected African countries between 1980–2016. The study adopts a Panel Autoregressive Distributed Lag (PARDL) bounds testing approach. The long-run estimates show that interest on debt payment, government expenditure, expected inflation, exchange rate, and government tax revenue all have positive relationships with private investment, suggesting fiscal measures crowd in private investment in the long run. However, in the short run, changes in the one-lagged variables have negative impacts, whereas two-lagged variables show positive impacts, indicating that fiscal measures may crowd out private investment in the short run. The paper recommends fiscal discipline for policymakers if private investment is to thrive in Africa.

Title: Export‑led or household consumption‑led growth in China: An empirical analysis  
Abstract: GDP growth dependence on various factors of the country during 1980–2013 (34 years) has been estimated. Ordinary Least Squares technique of regression is applied here. The results indicate that devaluation in the Yuan, considering real effective and nominal exchange rates, has an impact. Further, the systematic effect of capital formation on GDP growth is greater than that of international trade and domestic household consumption expenditure. This signifies the importance of the domestic economy in contrast to the general belief of external sector dependence of Chinese growth.

Title: The Decommissioning of the Middle Class
Abstract: The euro crisis has threatened the balance of social structures, through the impoverishment of the middle class, in almost all countries of the Old Continent. This trend has not only posed a threat to social cohesion, but it also threatens the very nature of the so‑called Western‑style Democracy. The reason is that there is a class that has always been a “cushion” that absorbs both the vibrations of competition and the confrontation of the social elite with the socially weak, offering the latter the ability to overcome their misery. In most capitalist economies, the middle class label is based on an economic definition that is largely based on a lifestyle that is based on a certain economic robustness and endurance. With the deepening of the crisis, however, the diversity of the middle class not only has it been jeopardized, but rather, it has gradually been replaced by a new demographic category called the “prekariat”. This new category consists of a group of people once in the middle class and currently marginalized. All of this leads to generalized uncertainty and totally unstable political attitudes, with intense mobility at the extremes. The rapid rise of right and left‑wing populism is an aspect of the threatened subjugation of the middle class strata. The consequences for societies when their layered center is lost are obvious and significant.

Title: Naturalization: The Case for Constitutional Reform to Extend Citizenship to Immigrants in Liberia  
Abstract: This study examines critical elements of extending citizenship to entrepreneurial minority  groups  (Lebanese,  Mandingos, Indians,  Nigerians,  and  Westerners)  and  Liberian dual  citizens  in  Liberia  by  analyzing  survey,  remittance,  and  naturalization  data  collected by Afrobarometer (Round 5and 6 Surveys), USD Explorer, 2015 Yearbook of Immigration Statistics,  and  TLC  Africa  from2011  to  2015.  This  is  accomplished  by  correlating associations between variables including Liberians’ gender in survey responses, attitudes of West  African  countries,  Liberian  naturalization  in  advanced  countries,  and  Liberia’s remittances (inflow and outflow) to show the economic advantages of awarding citizenship to  foreigners.  The  long  run  result  reveals  that  attracting  entrepreneurial  groups  increases investment  in  new  domestic  firms,  which  will  likely  lead  to  transformation  in  national industries,  enhancement of citizens’ technical skills, creation of permanent employment, and improvement of citizens’ living standards, as well as increased democratization.

Title: The impact of foreign direct investment on economic growth: Evidence from MERCOSUR countries  
Abstract: This study is a literary analysis with the purpose of verifying the dynamic relation of  the  São  Paulo  stock  exchange  index  with  some macroeconomic  variables,  between January 2014 and August 2017, when Brazil was going through a serious political crisis, in which  the  economic  activity  was  affected  and  therefore  the  stock  market.  Thus,  these relationships are evaluated by the Johansen Cointegration Test to precisely verify the long-term  relationship  between  the  Brazilian  stock  market  and  the  other  variables.  And  the results  indicate  a  negative  weight  of  inflation  expectations,  interest  rates  and  public  debt, while the exchange rate and economic activity positively affect the stock market index.

Title: Economic Globalization and Poverty Reduction: A Nigerian Perspective  
Abstract: This  study  aimed  to  look  at  the  impact  of  economic  globalization  on  African countries  with  special  attention  to Nigeria.  It  tried  to  answer  the  fundamental  question underpinning  globalization:    Has  globalization  really  increased  poverty  as  against  poverty reduction   in   Africa?   The   philosophy   behind   globalization   envisages   the   growing interconnection   of   human   activities,   the   imperatives   of   local,   national   and   regional economic   integration   and   interdependence   as  well   as   responding   together   to   global problems. Dependency theory gave basis to the work in order to ventilate the subject of the study. Data for the study was collected from a secondary source. Descriptive statistics was used in analyzing the data. The Chi-square and the F-distribution done with the help of E-views  showed  that  economic  globalization  has  increased  poverty  as  against  poverty reduction  in  Nigeria. Consequently,  the  study  recommended  a  way  out:  globalization properly understood, translates into human, economic and ecological solidarity.

Title: Exchange rate fluctuations and the trade balance between China and Australia: An empirical study
Abstract: This  paper  uses  Johansen  cointegration  test  and  a  vector  error  correction  model (VEC) to analyze the relationship between the trade balance and real bilateral exchange rate among Australia and China during 1990 to 2016.This paper suggest that the fluctuations of the  real exchange  rate  will have  impacts for China  and Australia  in the  short run, but will have little or no impacts in the long run. This is inconsistent with the findings of previous studies suggesting that there has a J-Curve effect in the long run. As to what factors in the long  run  have  cushioned  the  impacts  of  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on  the  trade  relations between Australia and China, we still need to continue exploring in the future.

Title: Does economic growth support the minimum wage? Evidences based in Turkey  
Abstract: The effects of the growth performances over minimum wages are examined in this study. Minimum wage is a level of income which is determined by the government in order people to be able to maintain humanitarian consumption rate under the economic conditions in which they survive. Such a partial interference to competitive economics can affect many macroeconomic variables. In this study, the relationship between minimum wage and the growth performance is investigated within fast growing Turkish economy. The effects of minimum wage over employment and how the employment rate changes by the effects of minimum wage increases reflect to the growth processes is depicted. After the applied tests, the results are acquired as there is co‑integration relationship in the long run between minimum wage and the growth and Granger causality occurred in double direction.

Abstract:This paper investigates the effectiveness of foreign exchange intervention of central banks of Canada and Switzerland. We examine the effectiveness of Canada and Switzerland interventions policies on Canadian dollaragainst US dollar and Swiss franc against US dollar exchange rates volatility over the 1980-2014 period. A behavioral exchange rate equation is estimated   with   instrumental   variables   methodology.   The   main   results   indicate   that interventions generally reduce exchange rates volatility. However, the Swiss National Bank seems to be  more  efficient by stabilizing the  Swiss  franc  than the  Bank of  Canada,  whose interventions, despite its effectiveness, remains weak.

Title:Theodore Ahlers &Harinder S. Kohli (eds.), Africa Reset: A New Way Forward, Oxford University Press, 2017, 260pp. $44Hardcover. 
Abstract:The African continent for long has been an enigma  for development economists, with  several  countries  witnessing  coexistence  of  rich  natural  resource  base,  pockets  of underdevelopment  and  political  instability.  With  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs) as a target, it is now imperative that the African countries, particularly thenations facing  development  challenges,need  to  contemplate  and  adopt  a  long-term  action  plan. However, the existing literature suggests that addressing the concerns of African countries requires  both  structural  and  regulatory  reforms.  Given  the  proliferation  of  regional  trade agreements (RTAs)  in the  world today, along with deepening of de-globalizing forces, the practical  concern  for  the  African  countries  is  to  increasingly  participate  in  Global  Value Chains  (GVCs)  and  International  Production  Networks  (IPNs),  enhance  value-addition within the domestic economy, promote equality in opportunitiesand create employment for the growing young population therein. In a sense Africa is at a juncture, where Asia stood several  decades  back.  The  volume  edited  by  Ahlers  and  Kohli,  an  attempt  to  analyze  the reform and consequently the growth path in Africa, is therefore a timely contribution to the existing literature.

Title:Unemployment and wages and centralization in wage bargaining: Some analytical explanations 
Abstract:This  paper  discusses  the  relation  between  centralization  in  union  bargaining  and  the  wage-(un)employment  mix.  Empirical  findings  point  to  a  positive  relation  between  the  degree of coordination in union bargaining and wages till a certain point, and a negative one afterwards. A theoretical argument fits such evidence, relying on the mechanism behind the free-rider  problem  in  union  bargaining.  If  earnings  taxes  were  introduced  to  finance  the  unemployment  insurance  fund,  that  relation  could  change.  The  impact  on  the  equilibrium  wages and multipliers in the several scenarios is briefly explored. Indirectly, an explanation for the shape of the empirical “wage curve” is also derived

Title:The contribution of participation banks in the development of the mixed banking system: The case of Turkish Republic 
Abstract:In this paper, we examine the impact of participation banks on the development of the   hybrid   banking   system   in   the   Turkish   Republic,   through   an   empirical   study   of independent  variables  that  represent  the  development  of  participation  banks  such  as allocated  funds,  raised  funds  and  net  profits,  and  the  development  of  the  mixed  banking system that is represented by total assets and this is during the period of December 2011 to July 2018, it’s about 80 observations. First, we will start with the unit root test such as ADF, PP and KPSS teststo verify the stationarity of all variables, then we will apply the Johansen cointegration  test  for  the  long-term  relationship  to  verify  if  there  is  a  long-term  co-integration  relationship  between  the  dependent  variable  and  the  independent  ones.  The results showed that all variables are stationary at the same level (2nd difference), so they are integrated  in  the  same  order  (I1),  while  the  Johansen  test  found  that  there  are  three  long-term  cointegration  relationships  between  the  variables  involved.  So,  we  concluded  that participation  banks  contribute  in  the  long  term  to  the  development  of  the  mixed  banking system of the Turkish Republic

Title:Searching for a development paradigm in Ghana: Can the ‘Beijing Consensus’ provide an Anchor? 
Abstract:Since independence,  Ghana  has  implemented  many  development  paradigms, from  big-push  state-led  industrialization  to  neoliberal  market-oriented  policies.  However, the  goal  of  industrialization  has  eluded  the  country.  In  recent  years,  new  home-grown policy  initiatives  are  beginning  to  replace  neoliberal  prescribed  policies  of  Western  donors and  financial  institutions.  This  study  explores  these  new  innovations  focusing  on  the  One District One Factory initiative. We make the case that the policy is an innovative thinking on industrialisation and may reflect a realignment of Ghana’s development paradigm with the Beijing Consensus after many years of being taunted as a success story of IMF-World Bank neoliberal reform programmes

Title:Crisis, institutional innovation and change management: Thoughts from the Greek case 
Abstract:This  article  explores  how  the  current  global  crisis  and  restructuring  of  global capitalism  is related  to  innovation,  in  broad  terms,  and  change  management.  The  aim  is to understand this relation by first presenting a synopsis of the approaches to the crisis of the Greek  socioeconomic  system,  second  focusing  on  the  concept  of  innovation  in  institutional terms,  and  third  examining  the  change  management  mechanisms  that  seem  useful  for  the articulation   of public   economic   policy   in   Stra.Tech.Man   terms   (synthesisof   Strategy-Technology-Management). We suggest that to overcome actual structural crises -such as the Greek  socioeconomic  crisis-the  implementation  and  valorization  of  well  balanced  and effectively implemented sets of institutional innovations is crucial, provided that integrated public policy change management mechanisms are in place.

Title:Searching for the credibility of monetary policy in Turkey: Evidence from structural VAR analysis 
Abstract: relationship between the macro shocks and the long-term inflation expectations leads to questioning the credibility of a central bank. This paper investigates the credibility of  the  Central  Bank  of  Turkey  by  analyzing  the  anchoring  effect  of  the  long-term  inflation expectations by using the uncertainty indicator. We conduct the analysis with the structural VAR   method   using   survey-based   inflation   expectations   data   as   well   as   economic uncertainty  index  data  developed  for  the  Turkish  economy.  Our  results  provided  evidence in favor of the existing de-anchoring process and imply that the monetary policy is not fully credible in Turkey during the period under investigation

Abstract:The  economics discipline is  a  dynamic,  foundational field in  the  social  sciences. With a host of scholars eager to share the knowledge they createwith the general public,the discipline addresses how scarce resources are allocated to meet human needs and objectives. Since  resources  are  scarce  and  societies  have  to  make  tradeoffs  between  competing  ends, economics offers a unique set of tools to address many of society’s most pressing concerns.Furthermore, it  is common  that  once  a  scholar winsa  Nobel  Prize in economicsthat  they produce a book for a broader public audienceto explain their ideas.

Title:Did Brexit change the behaviour of the UK’s financial markets? 
Abstract:The  recent  UK  referendum  results  and  subsequent  initiation  of  Article  50  in  the 2007   Lisbon   Treaty   setin  motion  the  UK’s  withdrawal  from  the  European  Union, acknowledge as Brexit. The result and subsequent action were unprecedented and for many unforeseeable.   Apart   from   the   political   instability   and   division   of   the   country,   the complicated  and  long  process  of  Brexit  have  both  economic  and  financial  consequences. With  this  in  mind,  we  analyse  the  impact  of  Brexit  on  four  main  British  financial  markets: Equity,  Foreign  Exchange,  Gold  and  Sovereign  Debt;  using  daily  data.  We  extendthe variance bound test proposed by Fakhry & Richter (2018) underpinned by an asymmetrical C-GARCH-m  model  of  volatility.  Unlike  many  in  the  past,  we  placed  the  emphasis  on  the stable markets; thus introducing the stable marketpre-condition hypothesis.We analyse the long and short run effects of Brexit on the stability of the UK’s financial market. Our results hint at a certain impact on the UK’s financial market in both the long and short runs on the market  stability  and  hence  efficiency.  This  seems  to  be  dictated  by  the  reaction  ofmarket participants to uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK

Title:Gender wage gap in the agricultural labor market of India: An empirical analysis 
Abstract:The gender wage gap in the agricultural labor market is observed in all the states of India. This paper will try to identify possible policies which can reduce this gender wise wage  discrimination  in  agricultural  labor  market.  We  consider  the  period  between  2010-11 to  2015-16 and  18  major states  of  India.  The  possible  factors which  can  create  an  impact  on gender  wage  gap  are  the  expansion  of  MGNREGP,  Self  Help  Group,  primary  education among rural women, expenditure on the social sector as a percentage of Net state domestic products and the cropping intensity. It initially assumes that Cropping Intensity of a state in a  specific  time  is  very  much  dependent  on  the  net  irrigated  area  ofthat  state  in  that  time. Our endogeneity test supports our claim. So, Instrumental variable method is applied in our Fixed Effect panel regression. The result shows that expansion of primary education among women, the number of self-help groups in the state and enhancement of cropping intensity through  improving  irrigation  facility  can  play  a  significant  role  to  reduce  the  male  and female  wage  discrimination  in  the  agricultural  labor  market  in  India.  But  participation  of women in MGNREGP and social sector expenditure as a percentage of NSDP fails to create any impact on the gender wage gap

Title:Government expenditures in Nigeria: Re-examination of Wagner’s law 
Abstract:Nigerian data covering 1981 to 2018 were applied to affirm Wagner’s law with respect  to  the  five  different  models.  The  significance  of  this  paper  is  to  establish  whether there   exists   a   relationship   between   total   government   expenditures   and   the   Nigerian economy.  To  accomplish  the  objective  of  this  paper,  data  were  sourced  from  the  Central Bank of Nigeria statistical bulletin of various years. Several statistical and econometric tests were  conducted.  The  results  obtained  revealed  that  there  exists  positive  and  statistical significance  as  well  as  a  long-run  relationship  between  the  variables  employed  in  the various models and that Wagner’s law was held to exist in the Nigerian  economy  in  the timeframe of the study.

Title:Bank credit to the private sector: VECM approach for Albania 
Abstract:This  study  evaluates  the  determinants  of  bank  credit  to  the  private  sector  in  Albania  from  2000  to  2017  using  a  Vector  Error  Correction  Model  which  includes  both  demand  and  supply-side  factors.  We  perform  Augmented  Dickey  Fuller  Test,  Phillips-Perron  test  and  Johansen  cointegration  test  to  ensure  the  stationarity  and  long-run relation between explanatory variables. The results show that credit to the private sector is positively related  to  economic  growth.  A  higher  lending  rate  will  decrease  the  bank  credit  to  the  private sector. Further, the decrease of non-performing loans and domestic government debt will increase the funds available for the private sector. The negative sign of error correction term  and  the  diagnostic  tests  for  autocorrelation,  normality  and  ARCH  effects  ensure  that  our model is properly defined.

Title:China’s enterprises   in Africa: Market entry strategies, implications for capacity building, and corporate social responsibility 
Abstract:The quest for Africa’s natural resources can be traced when the Portuguese set foot on  African  soil  some  600  years.  This  was  followed  by  Western  Europeans  and  now  China.    Africa is endowed with huge reserves of mineral and natural resources. These have been the constant  attraction  to  foreign  countries  seeking  to  control  these  natural  resources  and  trading.  Globalization  further  made  the  new  scramble  for  Africa  eminent.  New  players including China are developing and employing new strategies on how to enter and control these new markets. Chinese enterprises employ the One Belt, One Road (OBOR) and the Belt and  Road  Initiative  (BRI)  market  entry  strategies  to  penetrate  the  African  Market.  This  has  alarmed the West

Title:The challenges of researching corporate power: The case of Shell Petroleum Development Company in Nigeria (SPDC) 
Abstract: The  research  on  Transnational  Corporations  (TNCs)  in  Nigeria  is  encumbered  or  fraught  with  methodological  challenges.  Thus,  this  paper  which  relies  on  desk  research,  unveils  the  conceptualization  of  TNCs,  Corporate  Powers  and  the  Doctrine  of  Domicile  thereby  interrogating  the  methodological  encumbrances  –  (security,  secrecy  and  access  challenges)  experienced  in  conducting  researches  on  the  modus  operandi  of  TNCs  in  Nigeria  with  focus  on  Shell  Petroleum  Development  Company  in  Nigeria  (SPDC).  The  consideration  of  Transnational  Corporations’  exploration  of  the  lacuna  created  by  weak  or  moribund state institutions, escalating corruption, lack of adequate knowledge of rights and double standards become sacrosanct in bringing about ease in the challenges of researching corporate power.  The  paper  argues  that  in  weak  African  states,  the  doctrine  of  domicile  manifests  through  threat  of  divestment,  undue  influence  on  government,  casualization  of  workers,  corrupt  practices  and  tax  evasion  where  corporate  power  employ  hegemonic  tendencies in pursuit of  its profit maximization drive..

Title:A simple model explaining the interaction between special interest spending and voter choices 
Abstract:This  research  develops  a  model  of  eligible  voters  rationally  maximizing  their  stochastic  utility  functions  in  their  decisions  with  respect  to  casting  ballots  in  elections  that  result  in  voting  decision  being  largely  determined  by  social  and  psychological  factors  heterogeneously  maleable  by  political  expenditures.  The  wealthiest  agents  utilize  their  overwhelming financial resources to promote only candidates cooperating with their special interests to attract public attention, which exerts social pressure on voters to cast ballots only for  those  politicians  who  represent  those  agents.  The  model,  which  enables  exacting  computation  of  the  benefits  to  politicians,  special  interest  groups,  and  voters  from  their  political  actions,  is  shown  to  supply  insightful  explanations  for  the  2016  U.S.  Presidential  polling  results  for  the  four  leading  candidates.  Voters  were  effectively  swayed  by  large political   expenditures   to   select   from   the   two   candidates   who   represented   the   agents   providing the financial backing to market their special interests

Title:Happy 20th birthday Euro: An integrated analysis of the stability status in the Eurozone’s equity markets 
Abstract:We celebrate the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the Euro by reviewing one of  the  key  elements:  the  integration  of  the  Eurozone  financial  markets.  Introducing  a  multivariate volatility test based on the asymmetrical BEKK (ABEKK) multivariate GARCH model  of  volatility  to  analyse  the  stable  market  pre-condition  hypothesis  of  the  integrated  Eurozone equity markets across the euro’s timeline. Extending our analysis to the impact of the rise of the populist political movement on the Eurozone financial markets during the last few  years.  The  first  and  most  important  contribution  is  the  introduction  of  a  multivariate  volatility test based on the ABEKK to analyse the stability of the integration in the Eurozone equity  markets.  However,  another  key  contribution  is  the  analysis  of  a  period  where  the  whole  concept  of  European  integration  is  coming  into  question  by  the  rise  of  the  populist  political  movement.  This  research  could  be  of  importance  to  the  ECB  in  stabilising  the  Eurozone  financial  markets  as  well  as  market  participants  in  portfolio  optimization  within  the Eurozone. Our results point to a difference in financial market integration depending on the   definition.   The   empirical   evidence   found   that   market   participants   tend   to   react   differently according to the affinity of the market participants to the event/news. In essence, market participants are driven by the “time and space” effect. This would point to evidence that  the  Eurozone  equity  markets  was  never  truly  integrated  in  the  econometrics  sense  as  defined  later  on.  However,  our  literature  review  did  identify  evidence  that  the  Eurozone  equity markets was integrated in accordance with the definition of Baele et al., (2004). Hence it really does depend on the definition used. Generally, our policy recommendations are for a  committee  to  be  setup  to  unify  the  communication  and  actions  of  the  European  Union  during crises. A better way of communicating the work and concept of the European Union to the population. Finally, a slower paced policy of integration to overcome the sense of loss national identity which recently many are plying on

Title:The Classical and Neoclassical theoretical traditions and the evolutionary study of the dynamics of globalization 
Abstract:This  article  aims  to  present  the  theoretical  foundations  of  the  classical  political  economy through the contributions of Adam Smith and David Ricardo and to find out how their neoclassical followers interpreted, evaluated, and transformed this classical theoretical basis. Specifically, we analyze from a critical point of view the neoclassical interpretation of globalization  by  arguing  that  this  theorization  is  probably  insufficient  in  analytical  terms.  We  conclude  that  an  analytical  counterproposal  for  the  relative  explanatory  insufficiencies  of the neoclassical synthesis is based on the modern evolutionary approach of globalization.

Title:The behaviour of imports in Cameroon:  An analysis through the equilibrium and disequilibrium models 
Abstract:We  have  attempted,  in  this  paper,  to  evaluate  the  structure  and  determinants  of  the demand for imports in Cameroon at the aggregated and disaggregated levels, using an equilibrium  and  disequilibrium  models. It  emerges  from  econometric  estimation  that  real  income, the real exchange rate and the variable capacity to importand industrialization were the  determining  factors  in  Cameroon  imports.  The  degradation  of  imports  illustrates  the  elastic  or  inelastic  nature  of  imported  products.  Cameroon  must  reshape  her development strategies  towards  industrialization  in  order  for  them  to  achieve  a  progressive  reduction  of  their  imports.  This  imperative  situation  would  be  a  means  that  cannot  be  ignored  by  the  Cameroon  if  it  wants  to  attract  foreign  direct  investment  which  is  a  source  for  the  development of firms and for boosting productivity.

Title:Pak-Japan comparative study of consumption tax (value added tax) and its effects on economic growth rate and gross savings 
Abstract: The purpose of this research attempt is to statistically observe the causal impact of consumption tax (value added tax) on GDP/economic growth and gross savings in Pakistan as  well  as  in  Japan  and  their  comparative  analysis  for  the  period  defined  (1989  to  2015).  Furthermore,  to  explore  if  the  increase  in  value-added  tax  is  either  contributing  to  rising  growth rate or increasing gross savings using time series secondary data. It is found through running  regression  that  tax  on  goods  and  services  (value  added  tax)  maintains  significant  and healthy/positive association with gross domestic product growth rate and gross saving in  Japan  and  Pakistan  also.  An  increase  in  value-added  tax  contributes  more  to  gross  savings  in  Japan  and  Pakistan  than  the  economic  growth  rate.  The  policymakers  in  Japan  and  Pakistan  need  to  design  policies  to  increase  value-added  tax  rates  to  increase  gross  savings that could be utilized to increase physical and human capital investment to increase more  production  to  achieve  sustained  economic  growth.  Also,  this  study  guides  Japan  and  Pakistan policymakers to restrict the export of the primary product to avoid value-added tax loss

Title:The dynamic interrelationship between interest rate and macroeconomic policy objectives: Case of the United Kingdom 
Abstract:The objective of this study is to provide empirical evidence on the short-and long-run relationships  between  the  short-term  interest  rate,  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)  and macroeconomic  policy  objectives,  such  as  price  stability,  economic  growth,and  stability  of  the exchange  rate  market.  For  this  purpose,  we  deploy  quarterly  frequency  data  from  the  United Kingdom between 2000 and 2015 and adopt a multiple regression model. Furthermore, this study uses  the  Johansen,  Stock-Watson  cointegration  testand  the  Granger  Causality  test  in  order  to examine the dynamic short-and long-run relationships among LIBOR, the consumer price index as a proxy of price stability, the real gross domestic product as a proxy of economic growth, and the  exchange  rate  as  aproxy  of  exchange  rate  market  stability.The  results  showed  that  all variables have the same order of integration and long-run equilibrium relationships exist between them. The results show evidence of long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables with strong  evidence  of  unidirectional granger  causality  flow  from  GDP,  CPI  and  exchange  rates  to LIBOR. The recommendations proposed in this study have important policy implications for the U.K.  government.  It  is  therefore  recommended  that  policy  makers  and  government  authorities together withthe Bank of England develop and pursue sensible fiscal and monetary policies that would aim at stabilizing both the micro-and macroeconomic indicators such as the inflation rate, interest rate, exchange rate, and money supply, to enhance the growth of the economy, especially for the period after the BREXIT decision

Title:Examining the correlation of the level of wage inequality with labor market institutions 
Abstract:Technological change is responsible for major changes in the labor market. One of the offspring of technological change is the SBTC, which is for many economists the leading cause  of  the  increasing  wage  inequality.  However,  despite  that  the  technological  change affected  similarly  the  majority  of  the  developed  countries,  nevertheless,  the  level  of  the increase of wage inequality wasn't similar. Following the predictions of the SBTC theory, the different  levels  of  inequality  could  be  due  to  varying  degrees  ofskill  inequality  between economies,  possibly  caused  by  variations  in  the  number  of  skilled  workers  available. However,  recent  research  shows  that  the  difference  mentioned  above  can  explain  a  small percentage  of  the  difference  between  countries.  Therefore,most  of  the  resulting  inequality could be due to the different ways in which the higher level of skills is valued in each labor market.  The  position  advocated  in  this  article  is  that  technological  change  is  largely  given for all countries without much scope to reverse. Therefore, in order to illustrate the changes in the structure of wage distribution that cause wage inequality, we need to understand how technology  affects  labor  market  institutions.In  this  sense,  the  pay  inequality  caused  by technological progress   is   not   a   phenomenon   we   passively   accept.   On   the   contrary, recognizing  that  the  structure  and  the  way  labor  market  institutions  function  is  largely influenced by the way institutions respond to technological change, we can understand and maybe reverse this underlyingwage inequality. Consequently, we would like to examine to what extent the reason behind the increase of wage inequality in some countries but not in others is attributed to the structure and the way the institutions of labor market work. In this article,  we  will   attempt   to   examine   this   hypothesis   by   empirically  elaboratingon   the relationship between SBTC, inequality and labor market institutions.

Title:Measuring the effects of structural reforms in Malta 
Abstract:tructural  reforms are crucial to  boost an economy’s long-term  growth  potential, enhance  its  resilienceand  increase its flexibility  to  adjust to  adverseshocks.  Malta  has implemented  a  number  of  reforms  in  recent  years,  both  to  its  labour  and  product  market, which could in part explain its stellar growth performance after the crisis. Furthermore, EU membership has facilitated the inflow of foreign labour that helped to address critical labour and skill shortages. This paper quantifies the macroeconomic effects of structural reforms in labour  and  product  markets  using  EAGLE,  a  large  scale  multi-country  DSGE  model, calibrated for the Maltese economy, as a small and open economy in a monetary union. The results  show  that  a  10  percentage  point  reduction  in  product  and  labour  mark-ups  raises GDP  by  more  than  5%  in  the  long-run.  The  implementation  of  the  reforms  in  isolation  is associated  with  adjustment  costs  but  the jointimplementation  of  reforms  can,  to  a  large extent,  soften  the  transition  costs  associated  with  the  reforms.  The  results  are  robust  to varying  levels  of  mark-ups  and  different  parameterization  of  the  model.  A  key  driver behind  this  finding  is  the adjustment  in  the labour  market.  This  calls  for  policies  to  further reduce skill mismatches and for incentives that attract and retain more people in the labour market

Title:An expanded multiplier-accelerator model 
Abstract:This  paper  revisits  the standard  multiplier-accelerator  model,  as  advanced  by Samuelson.  While  borrowing  on  the  main  assumptions  of  the  multiplier-accelerator,  we check   the   validity   of   Keynesian   theory.   Using  higher-order   difference   equations   and advanced-level mathematical techniques we solve the tax-augmented multiplier-accelerator model,  as  well  as  the  open  economy  one.  We  find  that  the  values  of  equilibrium  national income  are  identical  to  the  simple  national-income  model  in  the  absence  of  the accelerator. We solve the simple multiplier-accelerator model both in present terms and withprolonged consumption. We solve for equilibrium consumption, tax, and imports which are unaffected by  the  accelerator.  All  results conform  to  Keynesian  theory where investment,  government spending and exports have a favorable multiplying effect on national income through their respective  multipliers.  The  accelerator  coefficient  affects  neither  those  multipliers,  nor  the income  and  the  non-income  tax  multipliers.  Expanding  the  multiplier-accelerator by  the volume of foreign trade, taxation or both does not change the values of Keynesian variables. Adding  an  accelerator  leaves  optimal  values  unaffected  but,  more  importantly,  reinforces Keynesian theory.

Title:The US-Pakistan relationship in South Asia, 2001-2012: A case study of Afghanistan 
Abstract:The    bilateral    relationship    between    Pakistan    and    the    US    created    since independence  in  1947  to  2012  Pakistan.    This  anxiety  assisted  Pakistan  to  examination partners  in  world  politics  and  produced  alignment with  the  US.  USconcentration  in  South Asia  was  to  comprehending  the  USSR  to  thwart  communist  enlargement  towards  the Middle East.  Pakistan amalgamated the US alliance arrangement to getting military aid and military  cooperation.    Pakistan  was  predictable  as  key  US  confederate  and  acknowledged bulky  quantities  of  military  aid.  In  the  Indo-Pakistan  War  US  did  not  buttressed  it  in contradiction  of  India  and  Pakistan  turned  to  China.  When  India  tested  nuclear  and Pakistan  to  hasten  its  own  nuclear  programme  in  contradictionof  the  non-proliferation intentions  of  the  US.  When  USSR  Confronted  on  Afghanistan  and  both  states  came  closer.  In   the   Afghan   civil   wars,   Pakistan   subsidized   the   pro-Pakistan   Taliban   and   tried  to admittance  gas  in  Central  Asia  and  encompass  Iranian  inspiration.  After  9/11  instance  US bequeathed Pakistan good aid compendium in contradiction of al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Later Pakistan was acknowledged non-NATO assistant. The US attacked with drones created anti-American feeling in Pakistan military. Other side Osama bin Laden was found  in  the  Pakistani  territory.  .  Notwithstanding  all  these  difficulties,  relations  never penniless down entirely and US continuous to bounce aid to the Pakistan.

Title:Richard Steckel, Clark Spencer Larsen, Charlotte Roberts & Joerg Baten (Eds.),The Backbone of Europe: Health, Diet, Work, and Violence over Two Millennia, Cambridge University Press, 2018, 476 pp. $85.43Hardcover 
Abstract:When   traditional  measures   for   material  welfare   are   scarce   or   unreliable,   a population’s  average  stature  reflects  its  cumulative  net  nutrition  during  economic development.  In the 1970s, Robert Fogel and his graduate students led the effort to integrate statures as an economic measure for welfare with their studies of American slavery, and the use of anthropometrics has been extended to various fields in economics, development, and economic  history  (Fogel  &  Engerman,  1974;  Fogel,  1989;  Fogel,  1994).    Few  scholars  have done as much to advance the use of height and anthropometric measures as Richard Steckel, a  Fogel  graduate  student.    Demonstrating  extraordinary  creativityto  bring  yet  another measurement  tool  thatsheds  light  on  economic  conditions,  Steckel  has  extended  the  use of stature of the living to the skeletal remains of the dead.

Title:Why does the amount of income redistribution differ between the United States and Europe? The Janus face of Switzerland 
Abstract:In  this  paper,  the  amount  of  income  redistribution  in  the  United  States,  the European  Union,  and  in  Switzerland  is  compared  and  empirically  related  to  economic, political, and behavioral determinants elaborated in the literature. Lying in between the two poles,  data  on  Switzerland  provides  evidence  about  the  relative  merits  of  competing hypotheses. It tips the balance against the economic explanation, which predicts more rather than  less  income  redistribution  in  the  United  States  compared  to  the  EU  in  general.  It  only weakly  supports  the  political  model  linking  proportional  representation  and  multiparty structure  (which  also  characterize  Switzerland)  to  redistribution;  yet  the  Swiss  share  of transfers in the GDP is low. Behavioral explanations receive a good deal of support from the case  of  Switzerland,  two  countries  that  share  with  the  United  States  the  belief  that  hard work rather than luck, birth, connections, and corruption determine wealth. In this way, the Janus faces of Switzerland may help to explain the difference in the amount of U.S. and EU income redistribution

Title:Modelling the shadow economy of South Africa: Using the currency demand and MIMIC approach 
Abstract:This  paper  estimates  the  size  and  development  of  the  South  African  shadow economy    (SE)    using    two    indirect    approaches    namely,    the    Multivariate    Indicator Multivariate  Causes  (MIMIC) model  and  the  Currency  Demand  Approach  (CDA).  The study  uses  time  series  from  2000  to  2019  (using  quarterly data)  to  estimate  the  SE  of  South Africa for the period 2004 to 2018. The average estimated size of the SE from  the CDA and MIMIC model are 22.47% and 25.45% respectively. Overall, the MIMIC and CDA models are both showing a slight decreasing trend for the same period. The study recommends further analysis   to   be   conducted   on   economic  segments   in   order   to   explore   the   SE  activity distribution between different economic sectors; resulting in an easier way to identify, locate and  monitor  unrecorded  businesses  and  also  increase  revenue  collections  and  minimise non-compliance for different sectors

Title:Union oligopoly and entry in the presence of homogeneous labor 
Abstract:The analysis discusses the labor market equilibrium under union oligopoly, where unions  represent  homogeneous  workers  and  use  employment  strategies.  The  following points  are  addressed:  1.  The  labor  market  outcomes  in  the  presence  of;  a.  uncooperative behavior  among  unions;  b.  uncooperative  environment  with  a  leading  union;  c.  collusive (coordinated   unions)   behavior   among   unions;   d.   globally   efficient   bargaining,   are confronted.  A  specific  example  with  a  Stone-Geary  utility  function  and  linear  demand  is forwarded.  2.  Supply  dynamics  may  push  up  employment  and,  therefore,the  number  of unions. In equilibrium, some bounds exist to the number of unions the market can support, which are investigated in the example. Five supply dynamics are considered: a. reservation wage restriction; b. a standard labor supply constraint; c. number of unions equal demand; d.  individualistic  unions;  e.  existence  of  a  minimum  (employed)  membership  requirement. The   equilibrium   number   of   unions   for   the   Cournot-Nash,   Stackelberg   and   efficient bargaining  structures  is  derived  for  the  case  where  unions exhibit  Stone-Geary  preferences and labor demand is linear

Title:Dynamic risk sharing in the Central African Economic and monetary community
Abstract:In  contrast  to  the  first  Optimum  Currency  Area  (OCA)  theory  which  was  mostly about  preventing  currency  areas’  exposure  to  asymmetric  shocks,  the  second  model introduced by Robert A. Mundell (1973) focuses on risk sharing across member states whenfacing adverse macroeconomic shocks. This paper explores how risk is shared across the six member states of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC). Using dynamic  panel  VAR,  we  measure  disposable  income  and  consumption  smoothing  of negative  output  shocks.  We  find  that  more  than  72  percent  of  GDP  idiosyncratic  shocks remain unsmoothed in the case of the Central African currency area from 1986 to 2018

Title:Effect of electronic commerce on output and total factor productivity in Kenya 
Abstract:Kenya  seeks  to  transform  into  a  middle-income  country  by  2030  with  target annual  growth  rates  of  10  percent.  However,  this  has  not  been  realized  since  growth  rates are  under  10  percent  while  36  percent  of  the  population  lives  below  the  poverty  line. Various  studies  interpret  this  as  an  underperformance.  However,  this  study  held  the  view that the economic growth witnessed in the years 2007 to 2018pointed to a resilient economy characterized by average steady growth rates of 5.4 percent despite the deterioration of the global  economic  outlook.  This  resilience  coincided  with  the  adoption  of  e-commerce, increased  output  in  absolute  values  and  emphasis  of  Information  and  Communication Technology  as  a  key  industry  under  the  economic  pillar  of  the  Kenya  Vision  2030.  The period  also  saw  the  emergence  of  mobile  payment  gateways,  which  is  a  key  enabler  for  E-commerce  among  others.  E-commerce  activities  increase  efficiency  and  ease  of  doing business  by  reducing  costs  and  barriers  of  operation,  which  are  important  for  achieving economic growth in transition countries such as Kenya. The main objective of the study was to  investigate  the  effect  of  e-commerce  on  output  and  total  factor  productivity.  The  study developed  a  framework  following  the  neoclassical  and  endogenous  growth  theories.  The study  used  quarterly  time-series  data  from  the  period  2007  to  2018  and  applied  Ordinary Least Squares regression models. The results showed that e-commerce had a positive effect on  output.  The  effect  of  e-commerce  on  Total  Factor  Productivity  was  positive  when considering  the  value  of  mobile  payments  while  that  of  card  payments  was  negative.  The results  suggest  that  continued  investments  towards  e-commerce  in  terms  of  capital  and mobile  payments  technology  will  be  important  for Kenya  to  sustain  output  growth  and productivity increase

Title:When armies don’t fight: Are militaries in India and Pakistan strategically aligned to promote peace in South Asia? 
Abstract:The paper analyses role of militaryspending and number of military personnel in India and Pakistan in conflict mitigation. The paper finds that Pakistan’s military spending is  a  cause  of  deterrence  from  Indian  hegemony  in  the  region  confirming  the  defence literature  that  puts  the  role  of  military  as  a  strategic  asset  for  a  country.  The  paper  also suggests  that  both  democracy  and  economic  development  puts  downward  pressures  on India  and  Pakistan  hostilities  however  democracy  is  not  a  sufficient  condition  in  itself  to mitigate  conflict.  The  innovation  of  the  paper  is  that  it  constructs  real  proxies  of  conflict from  the  defence  literature  and  utilizes  defence  spending  in  the  analysis  as  a  means  to  a peaceful resolution between bilateral issues within South Asian region.

Title:s the Balassa-Samuelson Hypothesis still relevant? Cross-country evidence from 1950 -2017 
Abstract:We  revisit  the  Balassa  and  Samuelson  hypothesis  based  on  the  relationship between  real  exchange  rate  and  total  factor  productivity  relative  to  the  United  States  and investigate  with  panel  data  set  of  182  countries  from  1950  to  2017.  Results,  suggest  that there  is  an  inverse  relationship  between  the  two,  an  increase  in  productivity  results  in  an increase in real exchange rate and the findings supports the hypothesis. We use a range of tests   including   Arellano-Bond   Dynamic   Panel   Data   (both   fixed   and   random   effect) estimator and findings validates the hypothesis. All these additional tests confirm that the relationship  between  real  exchange  rate  and  relative  factor  producity  are  related  in  the long-run also

Title:A gravity model for international trade and conflict 
Abstract:This  paper  investigates  the  nexus  between  conflict  and  trade  using  data  from  77 countries.  For this  purpose,  it  puts  forward  a  gravity  model  that  is  augmented  with interstate   conflict   casualties.   In   order   to   overcome   statistical   problems   related   to heteroscedasticity  and  the  omission  of  the  extensive  margin  (the  zero  observations),  the gravity  modelis  estimated  using  a  Poisson  Pseudo-Maximum  Likelihood  method  (PPML). The  model  suggests  a  downward  impact  on  trade  that  affects  all  sides  of  the  conflict, whether  they  suffer  casualties  or  deal  them.  However,  said  impact  remains  small,  which hints  that  even  before  direct  conflicts  occur,  the  involved  countries  are  less  likely  to  have significant trade flows.

Title:The potential of Islamic financial institutions in promoting small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Ethiopia 
Abstract:It is universally proclaimed that SMEs are engines of growth and development in various  countries  in  the  world.  Nonetheless,  access  to  finance  remained  an  acute  obstacle.This paper aims toassess the potential of Islamic financial institutions in promoting SMEs to get access to alternative financial services in Ethiopia. Similar to other developingcountries, SMEs in Ethiopia have lack of access to finance and alternative financial services. Hence, the experience  of  other  countries  show  that  Islamic  financial  institutions  have  been  providing alternative  services  based  on  risk  sharing,  asset-based  and  ethical  principlesin  order  to achieve  financial  inclusion  and  wide-ranging  growth.  In  order to  encourage  SMEs  to  get access  to  alternative  source  of  finance,  regulatory  and  legal  frameworks,  proper  financial infrastructure,  market  and  industry  issues,  awareness  creation,  and  producing  trained workforce should get proper attention

Title:The growth and development analytical controversies in economic science: A reassessment for the post-Covid-19 era 
Abstract: A repositioning of the theoretical instruments of development and growth in the context  of  economics  and  political  economy  that  we  have  at  our  disposal  to  date  seems necessary,  especially  after  the  structural  transformation  caused  by  the  COVID-19  socio-economic  and  pandemic  crisis.  Specifically,  the  overcoming  of  the  COVID-19  era  of  crisis seems   to   depend   on   how   we   will   manage   to   re-perceive   the   theory   of   economic development  and  apply  its  proposals  in  new  economic  policies,  in  global  terms.  In  this context,  this  article  examines  whether  the  conceptual  and  ‚therapeutic‛  foundations  of development economics have today the necessary potential to cope with structural changes caused  by  the  ongoing  global  socio-economic  crisis.  We  assess  the  current  debate  in  theliterature of ‚economic development versus economic growth‛ and conclude that a new, comprehensive  and  evolutionary,  orientation  to  understanding  economic  development seems  necessary  to  respond  to  new  global  challenges  for  the  post-COVID-19  era.  We propose a multidisciplinary and evolutionary conceptual direction that suggests the multi-angle understanding of diverse historical configurations. We argue that all socio-economic mutations  accelerated  by  the  current  pandemic  crisis  have  systemic  and  evolutionary content and effects and cannot be reliably perceived as mere coincidences of ‚quantities‛ and growth ‚performances.‛ In this way, we can only disagree with any static and linear approach  to  the  current  crisis  that  directly  or  indirectly  leads  to  reproducing  the  rigid enclosure  of  the  analysis  in  partial  specializations  of  economics.  On  the  contrary,  we counter-propose  a  theoretical  response  of  evolutionary  type to assess  the  contemporary theory of economic development and the political economy in the post-COVID-19 era as an interdisciplinary crossroads for all socio-economic sciences.

Title:AHP analysis of classifying and positioning the crucial influential factors of brand establishment in the semiconductor industry 
Abstract:This   study   categorizes   the   crucial   influencing   factors   and   positions   them according   to   their   importance   in   achieving   the   impact   of   semiconductor   brand establishment  on  improving  corporate  performance  and  meeting  customer  needs.  This study conducted an in-depth literature review that recognizes the crucial factors necessary for  implementing  influence  in  establishing  a semiconductor  brand.  This  study  identifies five main variables and 17 subvariables, including ‚Customer value‛, ‚Brand equity‛, ‚Brand loyalty‛, ‚Brand orientation‛ and ‚Brand performance‛, and provides experts’ suggestions. They  performed  the  positioning  of  17  subvariables  and  5  main  variables representing   crucial   influential   factors   using   an   analytical   hierarchy   process   (AHP) technique per their relevance in crucial influential factor implementation.Theresults show that   5   main   variables   and   17   subvariables   play   a   vital   role   in   the   successful implementationof the impact of establishing a semiconductor brand, and ‚Customer value‛ has  gained  more  weight  compared to the other main variables. ‘Addressing problem’, ‘Superior  value’  and  ‘New product  development’  are  more  important  than  are  other subvariables. The limitation of this study is that, first, although this study consults experts from  the  semiconductor  industry  and  academia  of  various  countries,  their  opinions  are only  relevant  to  their  regions.  Second,  the  development  of  this  model  only  applies  to  the semiconductor  industry.  Third,  only  expert  opinion  variables  were  used  for  pairwise comparisons.   This   study   compensates   for   the   lack   of   key   factors   in   establishing   a semiconductor brand, using the literature and expert questionnaires to obtain the weight of each factor through the AHP method and ranking them in order of importance. It examines the  overall  situation  of  the  practice  of  building  brand  comprehension,  missing  no  factor, understanding where the key points areand using them effectively. This research advances the implementation focus  of the key factors that affect the establishment of semiconductor brands.  According  to  the  results  of  the  literature  review,  this  study  is  the  first  on implementing key factors affecting the establishment of a semiconductor brand. This study attempts to fill this gap

Title:From optimism to pessimism: The stability of the Euro FX market in the short and long run 
Abstract:We review the EU’s actions over the euro’s lifetime; since its introduction thru to the  populist  uprising  of  the  late  2010s.  The  euro  was  introduced  on  a  wave  of  optimism throughout  the  EU,  although  based  on  a  compromised  monetary  agreement.  Essentially, underlining  the  crisis  and  movement  from  optimism  to  pessimism  in  the  EU  integration road.  Thus,  it  is  hard  to  analyse  the  euro  without  reviewing  the  theories  influencing  this road.  Furthermore,  we  analyse  the  long  and  short-run  market  stability  of  the  euroFX market using the variance bound model of (Fakhry & Richter, 2018). However, it is difficult to  explain  the  market  analysis  without  referencing  behavioural  finance.  Thus  we  use  key elements of behavioural finance, such as the opposite scale behaviours of greed and fear, to fully explain the timeline analysis of the euro FX market stability in both the long and short runs. At first glance, the result was unexpected due to the critical factor that the market wassignificantly  volatile  in  the  long  run;  despite  conventional  wisdom  dictating  that  in  the long-run,  the  financial  markets  are  generally  stable.  One  possible  explanation  is  that  the market participants are fearful of the long-run future of the Euro

Title:Intergenerational transmission of culture among immigrants: Gender gap in education among first and second generations 
Abstract:This  paper  illustrates  the  intergenerational  transmission  of  the  gender  gap  in education  among  first  and  second-generation  immigrants.  Using  the Current  Population Survey (1994-2018), we find that the difference in female-male education persists from the home country to the new environment. A one standard deviation increase of the ancestral country’s female-male  difference  in  schooling  is  associated  with  17.2%  and  2.5%  of  a standard  deviation  increase  in  the  gender  gap  among  first  and  second  generations, respectively.  Since  gender  perspective  in  education  uncovers  a  new  channel  for  cultural transmission  among  families, we  interpret  the  findings  as  evidence  of  cultural  persistence among first generations and partial cultural assimilation of  second generations. Moreover, Disaggregation   into   country-groups   reveals   different   paths   for   this   transmission: descendants  of  immigrants  of  lower-income  countriesshow  fewer  attachments  to  the gender opinions of their home country. Average local education of natives can facilitate the acculturation  process.  Immigrants  residing  in  states  with  higher  education  reveal  a  lower tendency to follow their home country attitudes regarding the gender gap

Title:Towards an explanation of the Euro FX market reaction in the EU: A review of European integration during the EU crises 
Abstract:We  review  market  participants' actions  and  the  EU  afterthe  introduction  of  the euro  and  during  the  crises  period  and  Brexit  process.  The  crucial  factor  is  the  feedback effect in the reactions of the market participants and the EU. The euro was introduced in a compromised monetary union agreement, essentially underlining the European integrative process issues that were highlighted by the euro crises. Hence, for this reason, it is hard to explain the euro crises without referencing the European integration theories. On the other hand,  it is  difficult  to  understate  the  behavioural  factors,  including  greed  and  fear,  in  the full explanation of thecrises. At the heart of this research is the introduction of a new model of  testing  the  stability  of  the  market  extending  the  variance  bound  test  of(Fakhry  & Richter,  2015)  underpinned  by  a  Markov  Switching  GARCH  model.  We  analyse  the stability  of  the  Euro  FX  Market  from  1st  January  1999  to  31st  December  2019.  We  found a mixture  of  over  and  under  reactions  defining  the  three  sub-periods  which  given  the  Euro heuristic influencing both the market participants’ and EU’s views seem to be an acceptable result

Title:Are they willing to participate? Areview on behavioral economics approach to voters turnout 
Abstract:This article investigates the fundamental factors influencing the rate and manner of  Electoral  participation  with  an  economic  model-based  approach.  In  this  study,  the structural  parameters  affecting  people's  decision  making  are  divided  into  two  categories. The  first  category  includes  general  topics  such  as  economic  and  livelihood  status,  cultural factors  and,  also,  psychological  variables.  In  this  section,  given  that  voters  are  analyzed within   the   context   of   consumer   behavior   theory,   inflation   and   unemployment   are considered  as  the  most  important  economic  factors.  The  second  group  of  factors  focuses more   on   the   type   of   voting,   with   emphasis   on   government   performance.   Since   the incumbent government and its supportive voters are in a game with two Nash equilibrium, and also  because  the  voters  in  most cases  are retrospect,  the  government  seeks  to  keep  its position by a deliberate change in economic factors, especially inflation and unemployment rates.  Finally,  to  better  understand  the  issue,  a  hypothetical  example  is  presented  and analyzed in a developing country in the form of a state-owned populist employment plan

Title:Financialization and political economy of financial regulation in Uganda 
Abstract:Firstly,  in  this  present  paper,  empirical  evidence  obtained  after  employing generalized least squares technique on the relevant sample data for Uganda over the 1970 to  2016  period,  shows  that  financialization  had  adverse  effect  on  economic  growth. Secondly, in Uganda during the sample period, deregulation (represented by exchange rate depreciation) enhanced financialization. Thirdly, financialization depressed investments in the  country  because  a  large  fraction  of  investments  could  have  been  diverted  away  from the real sector to the financial sector. Fourthly, financialization had positive and significant effects  on  inflation,  quantity  of  foreign  exchange  and  balance  of  payments  deficit.  Lastly, empirical  evidence  indicates  that  financialization  was  as  a  result  of  increase  in  exchange rate   and   gold   reserves,   monetization   of   the   economy,   imports   and   movements   in household  disposable  income  relative  to  GDP.  Results  in  the  paper  suggest  the  following recommendations:    control    of    financialization    through    macro    prudential    financial regulation,  reduction  of  balance  of  payments  deficit,  undertaking  more  investments  in directly  productive  areas  and  control  of  the  relative  movements  in  disposable  household consumption relative to GDP

Title:Bank credit and transmission mechanisms of monetary policy in Uganda 
Abstract:This  paper  examines  the  effect  of  monetary  policy  on  bank  credit  in  Uganda during  the  January  2008  to  December  2017  period.  By  using  macro  level  monthly  data,  it tests for the existence of monetary policy transmission channels, in particular the presence of bank credit channel in the economy of Uganda. This is done by showing that bank credit growth in Uganda is affected by monetary policy shocks. Before conducting data analysis, tight bank credit models were built with the view of making the analysis mimic the actual behavior of bank credit and the monetary policy transmission mechanism. Data used in the empirical analysis are from Bank of Uganda. Empirical analysis is conducted by using the generalized least squares (GLS) technique. The advantage with the GLS method is that it is generally  more  efficient  because  it  eliminates  both  serial  correlation  and  variance  values that are not constant.The empirical results establish presence of the bank credit channel of the  monetary  policy  transmission  mechanism  in  Uganda.  Secondly,  the  empirical  tests conducted  establish  that  the  relationship  between  reserves and  loans  typically  operates  in the reverse way to that described in some economics textbooks. Similarly, the relationship between bank deposits and bank deposits is found in principle to  operate  only during the current month in the reverse way to that described in some economics textbooks. Thirdly, empirical  tests  conducted  indicate  that  1  percent  increase  in  money  supply  (M2)  is responsible for causing 2.2 percent monthly increase in bank deposits in Uganda during the sample period, ceteris paribus.

Title:The contribution of human capital to the economic development of Cameroon, 1980-2018 
Abstract:The   paper examines   the   contribution   of   human   capital   to   the   economic development of Cameroon from 1980¬-2018. To achieve this objective, data were collected from  World  Bank  Development  Indicators,  for  Cameroon,  covering  the  period  of  1980-2018. The error correction mechanism model was used to analyse the data using STATA 14 econometric  software  package.  The  results  show  that  human  capital  has  a  positive  and significant  relationship  with  economic  development  in  Cameroon.  The  findings  suggest that  gross  school  enrolment  and  labour  force  participation  had  slowed  down  economic development in Cameroon. The study recommends that given a significant coefficient of human capital on economic development in Cameroon, the government should create an enabling  environment  to  reinforce  the  implementation  of  gross  school  enrolment,  health expenditure and labour force  participation policies to accelerate the process  of economic development in the country

Title:The determinants of the intermediate products export: The case of Switzerland 
Abstract:International   trade   relations   are   an   important   aspect   of   the   international economy.  The  form  and  structure  of  international  trade  has  changed  in  recent  years  and this  fact  deserves  particular  analysis.  Global  value  chains  are  an  significant  objectivity  in today's  times.  It  is  noteworthy  that  global  supply  (or  value)  chains  are  basically  the production  networks  that  span  multiple  countries,  with  at  least  one  country  importing inputs  (intermediate  goods)  and  exporting  production  (final  goods).  Many  products  in today's   era   consist   of   intermediate   inputs   from   other   countries.   The   proportion   of intermediate goods that a country exports helpsit to become a key trading partner. Value-added  imports  have  such  an  essential  role  in  the  exports  of  countries  that  they  ultimately determine the price of final goods. Moreover, intermediate goods have the characteristic of being  shaped  on  the  basis  of  their  technological  level.  That  is,  an  input  can  be  labour-intensive   or   technology-intensive.   Virtually   any   commodity   can   be   considered   an intermediary.  There  is  no  clear  definition  of  intermediate  goods.  This  point,  of  course, makes  it  difficult  to  identify  those  factors  which  determine  the  exports  of  intermediate goods. In this reality the exports of intermediate goods are worthy of further research. The present  study  will  attempt  to  investigate  the  determinants  of  intermediate  goods  exports using  Switzerland  as  a  case  study.  The  methodology  adopted  is  Linear  Regression -Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).

Title:Exchange arrangements and speculative attacks: Is there a link? 
Abstract:The  purpose  of  this  article  is  to  empirically  investigate  which  exchange rate arrangements are associated with more speculative attacks in the foreign exchange market, a relationship which is estimated using a least squares dummy variables panel data model. Also, this article addresses the issue of measurement errors in the classification of exchange rate regimes by using four different classification schemes. Three de facto and one de jure classifications  are  used.  Consequently,  the  sensitivity  of  these  results  to  alternative exchange rate classifications is also tested. The empirical findings indicate clear support for fixed regimes particularly in emerging and developing countries.

Title:Identifying the effect of parenthood on labor force participation: A gender comparison 
Abstract: Identifying  the  factors  that  influence  labor force  participation  could  elucidate how individuals arrive at their labor supply decisions, whose understanding is, in turn, of crucial  importance  in analyzing  how  the  supply  side  of  the  labor  market  functions.  This paper  investigates  the  effect  of  parenthood  status  on  Labor  Force  Participation  (LFP) decisions  using  an  individual-level  fixed-effects  identification  strategy.  The  differences across individuals and over time in having or not having children as well as being or not being  in  the  labor  force  provide  the  variation  needed  to  assess  the  association  between individuals’ LFP behavior and parenthood. Parenthood could have different impacts on mothers  than  it  would  on  fathers.  In  order  to  look  at  the  causal  effect  of  maternity  and paternity on LFP separately, the data is disaggregated by gender. To this end, the effect of a change in the parenthood status can be measured using individual-level fixed-effects to account for  time-invariant characteristics of individuals becoming a parent. The primary data  source  used  is  the  National  Longitudinal  Surveys  (NLS).  Considering  the  nature  of LFP  variable,  this  paper  employs  Binary  Response  Models  (BRMs)  to  estimate  LFP equations   using   individual-level   micro   data.   The   findings   of   the   study   show   that parenthood  has  anegative  overall  effect  on  LFP.  However,  paternity  has  a  significant positive  effect  on  the  likelihood  of  being  in  the  labor  force,  whilst  maternity  has  a significant  negative  impact  of  LFP.  In  addition,  the  results  imply  that  the  effect  of parenthood on LFP has been fading away over time, regardless of the gender of parents. These two pieces of evidence precisely map onto the theoretical predictions made by the related mainstream economic theories (the traditional neoclassical theory of labor supply as well as Becker’s household production model). These results are robust across different models specified and various estimation methods employed. These findings can contribute to the existing knowledge about the effect of parenthood on LFP decisions made in the US at an individual and behavioral level, and also aid in the shaping of economic policies and interventions to enhance the status of labor force participation in the economy. In the end, some  potential  threats  to  the  identification  of  this  causal  effect,  such  as  endogeneity  of fertility, and some possible strategies to deal with those threats are discussed.

Title:Economic reforms and economic growth in Nigeria:A Chow test approch 
Abstract:The  study  examined  the  impact  of  economic  reform programmes  on  economic growth in Nigeria for the period 1980 –2016. This period was selected since it covered the period   of   three   main   economic   reform   programme   in   Nigeria   history.   The   reform programmes during the period were the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP)of 1986, The  National  Economic  Empowerment  and  Development  Strategy  (NEEDS)  of  2004  and the  transformation  agenda  of  2011.  A  combination  of  co-integration  and  error  correction modelling techniques and the chow breakpoint test were employed. Inthe estimation of the specified   model,   dummy   variables   were   constructed   to   capture   economic   reform programmes. The chow test was adopted to confirm the findings from the error correction representation  by  checking  for  structural  brakes  the  growth  function.  The  empirical result shows  that  economic  reforms  on  the  aggregate  have  positive  and  statistically  significant long run impact on economic growth in Nigeria. However, in the short run the impact was negative.  This  suggest  that  economic  reform  had  a  J  curve  effect  on  economic  growth  in Nigeria. The J curve effect occur when a policy or programme have adverse effect in period immediately  after  its  implementation.  However,  the  effect  reverse  in  the  long  run  and become   positive.   For   the   individual   reform   programme,   the   structural   Adjustment Programme (SAP) of 1986 didn’t enhance economic growth in Nigeria. It even retarded economic growth with its negative coefficient. The National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) of 2004 and the transformation agenda of 2011 stimulated economic  growth  in  Nigeria.  This  propelled  the  Nigeria  economy  to  become  the  biggest economy  in  2013  overtaking  South  Africa.  Generally,  the  economic  growth  stimulated  by economic reforms did not transform into economic development as the poverty level is still high, unemployment rate and other social indicator have negative trend. This could be as a result of abandonment of economic reforms following changes in political leadership of the country.  This  study  therefore  recommend  the  need  to  go  back  to  government  deliberate home  grown  economic  reform  programme  to  lunch  the  country  back  of  a  steady  growth path  which  with  the  mind  of  attacking  the  poverty  problem  in  Nigeria  particularly  as  we approach the post covid-19 economic policy.

Title:How is monetary policy transmittedto the Human Development Index? 
Abstract:Identifying    the   monetary policy    transmission    channels    to    the    Human Development  Index  (HDI)  is  a  matter  of  great  concern  for  analysts  and  economic  policy decision takers, dealing with social welfare in the less developed countries. The exploration of   those   transmission   mechanisms, using   the   conventional   structural   Autoregressive methodology,  with  Cameroon  data  from  the  World  Bank,  Beac  and  UNDP,  on  the  period from 1990 to 2015, points out that HDI reacts significantly to the monetary policy impulses in  a  two  years  delay,  through  twochannels:  the “income-consumption  channel” and “credit-consumption channel”. In addition, it appears that inflation has a negative effect on the HDI.

Title:Mechanism of institutional transition, political instability and expansion of local power through civil wars: A model and comparative history 
Abstract:In this study, in order to examine the turning point of institutional change, we analyzed civil wars from four aspects. Theoretical, simulation, empirical analysis, and case studies. By endogenizing political, economic, and military factors in the model, we have clarified the mechanisms by which civil wars occur. The robustness of the model is evident from simulation analysis and real-life cases. We showed that the weaker the initial challenger to the government, the greater the contribution of cooperation from the population and a third force to the challenger in the process of civil war, and thus the challenger cannot create a new autocratic government with a single group after winning the civil war. The challenger also has the advantage of prolonging the civil war. For the challenger, the probability of winning the civil war increases with the proximity of the challenger's political ideology to the population, and the probability of the challenger winning the civil war is also higher when the government loses the maintenance of the population's property and public goods and the stability of the price level. The decrease in the value of public and private goods of the population due to the hyperinflation described will lower the utility of both urban and rural residents.

Abstract:By mid-2022, if not earlier, it was clear that the Federal Reserve’s inflation policy had failed. Not only did the Fed not focus on broad monetary aggregates (M2, M3, etc.), it also was not responsive to changes in end variables –an accelerating CPI indicator or Nominal GDP (NGDP). The Fed’s failing here reflects neglect by many non-Fed economists – eg, Krugman – of the same factors. The Fed has fitfully introduced average inflation targeting (AIT) over the last few years, which allows some flexibility depending on other economic variables, hence some counter-cyclicality in its methodology; it is a step toward NGDP targeting. But here too, the Powell Fed seemed not to notice cautionary signals.  By early 2022, however, monetary indicators had turned flat–just as the Powell Fed accelerated rate increases. Similarly, the dollar was rising against most other currencies, more presumptive evidence that US monetary policy is now contractionary. If we consider normal lag times, the Fed is likely to be over-doing it, so that an unnecessary recession may be in the works for 2023 or early 2024. One argument says that US pandemic and other spending in 2020 contributed to the inflationary surge in late 2021 and 2022. That is not likely: the world’s demand for treasury securities is quite robust. The US central bank does not need to monetize debt, which is the channel through which deficit spending would become inflationary. The Fed policy of paying interest on excess reserves (IOER) contributed to deflationary results during the decade following the 2008-2009 recession, a consequence of which was zero-bound interest rates. IOER, combined with the Fed’s policy of quantitative easing, resulted in a greater public sector role in resource allocation.

Title:Monetary policy framework changes and the money demand function 
Abstract:This paper investigates whether the monetary policy framework has changed since the introduction of inflation targeting in Thailand. We analyze the changes in the model of monetary policy and estimate its effects by estimating the demand function for money. We obtain four results from our analysis. First, changes in the monetary policy framework did not change the model of the money demand function. Second, the adoption of inflation targeting policy leads to structural changes. Third, the effects of monetary policy changed with the adoption of inflation targeting policy. Interest rate elasticity is positive before the framework change but negative after the policy change. However, its value is weak. Fourth, the interest rate elasticities of M2 and r are stable and predictable. This is important because the domestic interest rate, not the exchange rate or the foreign interest rate, controls monetary policy. It can also be applied with the same money demand function as in advanced economies.

Title:The currency board monetary system over 100 years in Bermuda (1915-2015) 
Abstract:We examine to what extent Bermuda’s monetary authorities have operated like currency boards, using statistical tests based on balance sheets and an analysis of Bermuda’s legislation. Our analysis indicates that in the early 20th century, Bermuda had a currency board system. In later years, problems with analyzing the balance sheet make a judgment based on statistical tests more difficult. We provide a companion spreadsheet workbook of annual or semiannual data of the monetary authority for the past 100 years.

Title:Endogenous growth model and the human capital development: Evidence from the West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ) 
Abstract:This study examined the effect of human capital development on economic growth in the context of West Africa Monetary Zone (WAMZ) countries for the period 2001 – 2019. The data for the study were sourced from World Development Indicators of the World Bank for the six (6) ECOWAS countries. The panel least squares (random effects and fixed effects modeling) were embraced as the estimation techniques. The empirical result of the study reveals a positive coefficient and statistically significant at 1% significance level in the fixed – effects model of the following macro economic variables government expenditure on education, Labour force and Population growth rate suggesting that they significantly stimulate economic growth in WAMZ countries. On the other hand government expenditure on health and investment income ratio had negative co-efficient with only investment income ratio statistically significant at 1% significance level. This indicates that urgent government action is required to reverse these negative trends in order to encourage health and investment contribution to economic growths in WAMZ countries. The study recommended among others that government of WAMZ countries should increase budget allocation to the education and health sectors for infrastructure and personnel development to foster a healthy work force that will promote economic growth.

Title:Exchange arrangements and economic growth: What relationship is there? 
Abstract: This article provides empirical support for the hypothesis that different exchange rate regimes have an impact on economic growth in advanced, emerging and developing countries. The effects of different exchange rate arrangements on economic growth are examined through least squares dummy variable regressions using panel data on 125 countries during the post-Bretton Woods period (1974-1999). Also, this article addresses the issue of measurement errors in the classification of exchange rate regimes by using four different classification schemes. Three de facto and one de jure classifications are used. Consequently, the sensitivity of these results to alternative exchange rate classifications is also tested. The empirical findings indicate that developing countries with fixed regimes tend to have a higher economic growth.

Title:Determinants of poverty among urban households in Afghanistan: Case study of Mazar-e-Sharif 
Abstract:This paper appraised urban poverty determinants in Afghanistan consider-ing Mazar-e-Sharif as a case study. The data was collected from 326 households using a multi stage sampling approach. The logit model was applied to estimate the influencing factors on poverty status among targeted households. The findings reveal that age of household head, remittances, number of male employed and number of female employed are negatively correlated with poverty status. While, household size and number of illiterate households member have positive impact on poverty in the study area. Thus, current research suggests government to invest more on education sector in order to increase the literacy among different social segments to finally reduce poverty through supply of literate manpower to the market “Policy implication”.

Title:Ashish Gupta & Amir Ullah Khan, India’s Infrastructural Challenges 
Abstract:India's congested road transport system, inordinate delays in railway passenger and freight movements, inefficient and lengthy turnaround time at ports, and fast-growing but overstretched airport sector all add to significant capacity constraints. According to experts, it also hurts the country’s potential growth trajectory by as much as 4 per cent to 5 per cent. Thus, infrastructure development can help remove some of these inefficiencies and contribute immediately to economic expansion through its multiplier effect and support more robust long-term growth.

Title:Venezuela’s tragic meltdown 
Abstract:Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to express my views on “Venezuela’s Tragic Meltdown.” A great deal of the commentary on the topic is polemical, and more-or-less political and ideological self-justifications of one sort or another. In consequence, the discourse is often confused and confusing. In an attempt to bring some clarity to the topic, I will focus on the one necessary condition that must be satisfied before the Venezuelan economy can be turned around. Inflation must be stopped before stability can be established. Stability might not be everything, but everything is nothing without stability.

Title:Exchange rate policy for whom? The political economy of exchange rate liberalization in Nigeria 
Abstract:The choice between a liberalized or administratively controlled exchange rate system have been a great dilemma in Nigeria. This study advances the exchange rate politics research by examining the political economy factors influencing the decision to liberalize Nigeria’s foreign exchange market. Using the Probit regression model and data for the period 1987 to 2019, the study finds that liberalization of Nigeria’s foreign exchange market is affected by politically influential economic sectors and urban consumers, especially the elite who benefit from the dirigiste exchange rate policy. The results are also consistent with the popular argument that Nigeria’s heavy dependence on importation which translate to persistent trade deficit makes the adoption of a liberalized market-determined exchange rate rather unfeasible. However, the limited flexibility in foreign exchange transactions has the unintended consequences of delivering little benefits to the economy due to the distortions created in the form of rent-seeking and corruption. The findings have implication for the need to pursue a pragmatic exchange rate policy by Nigerian authorities; and for international policy advisors to consider the policymakers’ domestic constraints and degree to which policies can be politically implemented in developing countries like Nigeria.

Title:The effect of roses crops on households income in Afghanistan: Case study from Dari Noor district, Nangarhar Province 
Abstract:Afghanistan is an agricultural country, employing 85% of the population. Nangarhar province is the main source of food in Afghanistan. Most of the crops are grown and consumed in the different districts of the province. This study aims to examine the impact of rose crops on household income in Dari Noor district of Nangarhar province. For this study we are uded time series data from the period of 2015 to 2018. This is the first attempt to study the impact of rose crops on household income at the country level. Both quantitative and qualitative research designs were used in this study. A sample of 300 farmers was used for the study. Primary data were collected using well-structured and planned questionnaires. Secondary data were obtained from various official sources, including Afghanistan's Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock, the World Bank, German Agro Action (GAA), and the International Center for Agricultural Research in Dry Areas (ICARDA). The data was analyzed using inferential statistics such as the Heteroskedasticity test, Granger causality test, Multicollinearity test, multiple regressions, and descriptive statistics. The findings of the study revealed that rose cultivation starting time, the farmer's age, the farmer's education, the farmer's training, work experience, the number of employed males, rose yields, agricultural yields, and the government policies all had a significant effect on households income. Furthermore, the number of employed females has a positive but insignificant impact on household income. These findings suggest that the Afghan government should consider using the farmer's education, working age, farmer's training,and work experience as policy tools to increase household income from rose cultivation. By using the OLS estimation method, this study contributes to the literature in Afghanistan.

Title:Labor income differentials between formal workers in civil construction in the Northeast: Comparison by Race/Color and Gender 
Abstract:Even though female insertion in the labor market has increased in recent years, studies have found an abyss in terms of wage inequality, in which, even with more years of schooling, women receive lower wages than men. In this context, this study sought to evaluate the labor market and wage inequalities between men and women in civil construction in the Northeast, in the years 2009 and 2019. Microdata from the Annual List of Social Information (RAIS) for the years 2009 and 2019 were used. Mincerian earnings equations were estimated using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models and Quantile Regression to measure the impacts of socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of formally employed workers in civil construction on earnings between men and women. The results show that there is income inequality between men and women, with men earning higher wages in civil construction, as well as wage inequality persisting by race/color, age, education, among others.

Title:Nowcasting quarterly GDP growth in Suriname with factor-MIDAS and mixed-frequency VAR models 
Abstract:We apply Factor-MIDAS (FaMIDAS) and Mixed-Frequency Vector Autoregression (MF-VAR and MF-Bayesian VAR) to nowcast quarterly GDP growth of Suriname. For this purpose, we use a set of 44 microeconomic indices over the sample period 2012Q1 - 2020Q2. In the target equation, we regress GDP growth upon its first lag and a beta coefficient. In the explanatory equations the first set of monthly regressors explain the variation of growth without lags while the second set of regressors are fitted with two-month lags. We apply three set of samples for model estimations: 2012Q1 – 2019Q3, 2012Q1 – 2020Q1 and 2012Q1 – 2020Q2. Model nowcast accuracy is benchmarked against GDP growth of 2019 and economic activity growth estimated by the monthly GDP indicator of March and June 2020. The models provide mixed results as compared to the benchmark indicators. We select the models with the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and based on own Judgment to nowcast. As the forecast horizon increases from 2019Q4 to 2020Q2, so do the RMSE. To hedge against high biases and variances, we combine the best nowcasts to produce a single nowcast. Furthermore, it appeared that the FaMIDAS and the MF-VAR models deliver adequate results for two nowcast horizons.

Title:The competence of the national congress in Brazil to decide on policy domains marked by a high degree of technical complexity 
Abstract:The competence of the Legislative Power has legitimacy on several bases. The representativeness of Congresspeople, for what purpose they were elected. The competence of Congress concerning its legal system. The institution's technical capacity to understand and decide on the matter. Moreover, the relationship between the Legislative and Executive Powers. All these aspects are essential; however, no single answer works for all countries. Thus, what is investigated in this research is whether, in Brazil, the decision on matters of a technical nature is better taken by the Legislative Power. Or whether these decisions are best resolved within the Executive, where specialists in the field are located. The conclusion is that the Brazilian Parliament works in a unique way but allows a partnership between the Legislative and Executive branches to promote effective governance. Currently, this partnership requires the Executive to relinquish one of its inherent powers, as several technical issues are being addressed within the Legislative Branch. Notwithstanding, that is not the best way to undertake those concerns that demand expertise.

Title:The Austrian School and crisis cycles 
Abstract:The causal-realist approach to political economy, characteristic of the Austrian School, readily explains the causes behind credit cycles and the distinct phases between booms and busts.  An underlying relationship between money, banking, property, contracts, and entrepreneurship is the key dynamic.  Policy interventions that that allow financial institutions to violate monetary property rights impart systemic risk leading to vacillations between periods of rhapsodic expansion and distressed contraction.  Escaping the crisis cycle requires adopting policies that affirm monetary property rights, enforce deposit contracts, and denies any political authorities that inhibit the choice of a commodity-based currency, or tolerates the legal abrogation of fiduciary responsibility relative to money substitutes. Only when credit issuance is restrained by the level of genuine savings in proper money will a natural rate of interest harmonize the structure of production with consumer preferences.

Title:Perceived self-efficacy and volition in the job search process among post-graduates: An exploration of employability intentions among young Cameroonians 
Abstract:Socio-professional integration is today, better than in the past, a social issue, a thorny issue that worries and leaves no one indifferent. It is a problem as old as the world, but which is still outdated because so far, we have not yet managed to control it in order to reduce it. According to the National Institute of Statistics (INS, 2010), about 75,000 young people arrive on the job market each year and nearly 40% of unemployed young people are higher education graduates. This research makes it possible to postulate that perceived self-efficacy is a determining factor in the volition of the job seeker.

Title:Impact of loadshedding in South Africa: A CGE analysis 
Abstract:The aim of this paper is to provide a practical contribution to the body of knowledge on the impact of loadshedding in South Africa. This study adopted a pragmatic research methodology by using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model for empirical analysis. This study estimates that loadshedding will reduce economic growth by 2.3%, this higher than the Banks earlier prediction of a 0.6%. This study is limited to the effects of loadshedding and shed light on the South African economy that has been adversely affected by the Covid 19 pandemic and its recovery trajectory which is now stifled by persistent load shedding. Empirical analysis of the effects of loadshedding through the usage of the CGE model establishes the originality of this study.

Title:The impact of lending on economic growth, the case of Albania 
Abstract:Lending is an important element for the economy of a country. Credit leads to an increase in spending, thus increasing revenue levels in the economy. This revenue growth brings a higher GDP (gross domestic product) and thus increases productivity. This paper aims to analyze whether there is a correlation between private sector credit and economic growth for the period 1996-2021 in the case of Albania using econometric models. We have to say that credit is one of the important elements of the financial system. Financial development over the years has brought a variety of products offered by the banking sector. But we must remember that lending, which is one of the main elements of this system, was one of the factors that caused the global crisis in 2008-2011. Hence, this study aims to discern whether lending has positively impacted the Albanian economy or not, considering its potential negative effects. It is a widely held belief that the absence of credit prevents a country's economic development, and this paper seeks to determine the accuracy of this claim. Due to the negative impact of credits on the economy in this paper we intend to survey how the loan has really affected the Albanian economy.

Title:Intergovernmental coordination and fiscal performance 
Abstract:This article evaluates the intergovernmental coordination of fiscal policy in Brazil, measured in terms of the synchronisation of fiscal responses adopted by the central and state governments between 2004 and 2016. An econometric analysis of Brazilian states' responses to central government fiscal impulses is conducted, controlling for variables that can affect states' fiscal performance, such as output gap, solvency, Dependency on intergovernmental transfers, expenditure decentralisation, and budget rigidity. The results show signs of a pro-cyclical nature in Brazilian states' fiscal outcomes, whereby a 1% increase/decrease in the central government's fiscal impulse leads to a 0.13% increase/decrease in the states' fiscal impulse. Evidence also found that greater dependency on intergovernmental transfers impairs states' fiscal performance. On the other hand, decentralisation of spending, high indebtedness, and greater budget rigidity are factors that lead to better fiscal discipline. The importance of this study consists in highlighting intergovernmental coordination as a strategy to ensure better efficiency of fiscal policy in the stabilizing and allocative functions of the budget.

Title:The Covid Pandemic Federal Reserve 
Abstract:The major tool of Federal Reserve monetary policy in non-crises has historically been open-market operations in securities markets. To stimulate the economy, the Federal Reserve injects monetary wealth into the economy by buying securities with what could be termed “freshly printed” money. To cool an overheated economy, the Federal Reserve withdraws monetary wealth from the economy by selling securities and, in effect, destroys its newly acquired money. At almost the onset of the effects of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve engaged in a massive asset expansion that was truly unprecedented. In just the first three months of the pandemic, March, April and May of 2020, the Federal Reserve bought $2.13 trillion in securities. But they didn’t stop there so that by April of 2022 the money injection reached $4.76 trillion, almost 20% of 2022 GDP! What is more astounding is that unlike the Great Recession interventions, there were no undergoing financial crises that triggered this massive expansion. The massive expansion was not only unprecedented and harmful as it has resulted in the end of the Federal Reserve’s annual transfers to the U. S. Treasury that in 2022 equaled 30.5 % of the net interest cost of the federal debt. The Covid-19 Federal Reserve actions will go down in monetary history as the worst Federal Reserve policy in the more than 100-year history of the Federal Reserve.

Title:Public service broadcasters and commercial media outlets with media bias in the changing media environment 
Abstract:In the current media environment, some commercial media outlets are offering more biased news than ever before with some public service broadcasters (PSBs) even appearing to disseminate biased news under political pressure. Under such conditions, can the media system ensure political accountability? This study theoretically examines how increased commercial media bias and politically pressured PSB bias affect political accountability and social welfare and discusses the role of PSBs in the changing media environment. We construct a two-period retrospective voting model in which voters obtain information from biased news. First, we present the conditions under which political accountability works even when biases exist. Second, we examine a case in which a PSB is politically pressured and present the bias selected by the PSB and the level of political accountability. We find that even if commercial media bias becomes extremely high, there are still cases in which political accountability works. Third, regarding two situations in which a PSB is mandated not to broadcast biased news and is politically pressured, we demonstrate how social welfare changes with an increase in commercial media bias and explore the social significance of PSBs. We discover that in the case of the anti-incumbent commercial media, when commercial media bias becomes relatively high, the existence of PSBs can always improve social welfare, even if PSBs are politically pressured.

Title:On the use of the Word “Political” 
Abstract:This paper explores the semantic complexities of the term "political" within scientific language. It identifies three distinct problems demanding separate analysis: (P1) Identifying Definitions: The first problem focuses on uncovering the explicit or implicit definitions various authors use for "political." It seeks to identify the properties that define political behavior, actions, systems, etc., through language descriptions. The goal is to establish a comprehensive list of these definitions, acknowledging the potential for partial definitions specific to certain contexts (e.g., political actions vs. political corporations). (P2) Conceptual Diversity: The second problem delves into the potential for distinct conceptualizations of "political" even when similar definitions are used. Here, the analysis ensures that definitions apply to the same range of entities and allows for the broadest possible interpretation (e.g., encompassing both behavior and action). This may involve creating a taxonomy of terms used alongside "political" to establish the level of complexity each definition introduces. (P3) Explicating "Political": The third problem addresses the possibility of referential diversity, where the term "political" might encompass different sets of entities depending on the definition. If such diversity exists, the paper explores the possibility of constructing an "explication" – a single, overarching concept of "political" that fulfills specific criteria. These criteria encompass clarity, non-redundancy, inclusivity within the relevant domain, theoretical fruitfulness, and mutual exclusivity of sets defined by separate partial definitions. The paper focuses on analyzing specific definitions proposed by prominent scholars like Max Weber, David Easton, and Harold Lasswell & Abraham Kaplan. By examining these definitions through the lens of the proposed criteria, the research aims to determine their effectiveness in capturing the multifaceted nature of "political" within scientific discourse.

Title:Are corruption and economic growth associated? Empirical evidence for Brazilian States 
Abstract:This paper seeks to investigate whether corruption influences and may be associated with per capita economic growth in Brazilian states. For this, information about per capita economic growth and an indicator of corruption for each Brazilian state are considered, in addition to control variables that aim to isolate the influence of corruption, such as the illiteracy rate of young people over 15 years old, population, GDP real, real GDP per capita, openness, total public expenditure, total public expenditure weighted by real GDP, total credit weighted real GDP and value-added of agriculture weighted by real GDP. The effects of these variables on per capita income are not linear and that is why the generalized method of moments (GMM) in 1st difference is used. The results indicate that corruption and economic growth are associated, and the three estimated models present the variables referring to the corruption indicator as statistically significant. These findings are useful for the scientific literature that investigates the influence of corruption on economic growth by bringing empirical evidence to Brazil and for more efficient decision-making by political decision-makers in combating corruption and the use of public resources.

Title:Government finance and the demand for money: The relation between taxation and the acceptability of fiat money 
Abstract:Requiring taxes to be paid in domestic money provides a valuable characteristic for a state’s money. In the case of a state’s fiat money, it is the foundation for money demand and hence to the development of a financial system built around state money. Except for relatively highly taxed countries, where taxes may encourage tax avoidance and holding bank deposits, the level of taxation is a positive factor boosting financial development. Granger causality tests for 65 countries over the past half-century test the relationship between money and government finance. Except for the low-income countries, where there are only five with adequate data, the causal relationship between taxation and money demand is generally supported in the 60 countries making up the three higher income groups.

Title:Is there a conflict of interest between Brazilian investment advisors and their clients? An econometric analysis from the perspective of the principal-agent problem 
Abstract:This paper investigates the Brazilian investment advisors' model of action. Starting from the principal-agent relationship, we sought to answer the following question: does the current Brazilian remuneration model for investment advisors reduce information asymmetry? For this, the theoretical model of Golec (1992) was adapted and panel data was used on Brazilian investment funds from 2010 to 2020. The results show that the current system of commissioning advisors does not reduce information asymmetry between investors and investment fund managers. Furthermore, given the large share of fixed-income funds in the Brazilian market, advisors do not have incentives to provide all the information they have to increase the profitability of investors' portfolios. These results are useful for the literature that studies the capital market by bringing empirical evidence to Brazil and financial market agents in general.

Title:Kidney disease, donation, and transplantation in East Africa 
Abstract:The burden of kidney failure remains largely underreported in East Africa. Health systems face numerous challenges including a lack of kidney registries, shortages of trained skilled healthcare workers, a lack of diagnostic support, a lack of equipment, and underdeveloped policies to govern the provision of treatment for kidney failure. Kidney transplantation, an effective treatment option against kidney failure, is underused primarily because of its cost and the lack of laws governing it. This paper discusses the salient issues affecting kidney donation and transplantation in East Africa.

Title:Multivariate risk exposure: Risk-premium, optimal decisions and mean-variance implications 
Abstract:This research develops and expands the concept of risk-premium to a multivariate environment, providing an operational framework for the analysis of mean-variance optimizers’ attitudes towards exogenous uncertainty. Firstly, it digresses over possible approximations to the risk premium. Secondly, importance and properties of the variance of the objective function are highlighted. Thirdly, impact of uncertainty on the objective function and on control variables of mean-variance agents is confronted with that of expected function optimizer’s. The analysis is also applied to ex-post flexible or adjustable environments with respect to the decision variables. Production theory examples are briefly sketched. Innovation in tools include matrix algebra results and representation of higher than second moments – with reference to the multinormal as a special case -, and implicit rules of first-order condition point-wise optimization of functions of expected value and of variance of other functions.

Title:Venezuela’s tragic meltdown 
Abstract:Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to express my views on “Venezuela’s Tragic Meltdown.” A great deal of the commentary on the topic is polemical, and more-or-less political and ideological self-justifications of one sort or another. In consequence, the discourse is often confused and confusing. In an attempt to bring some clarity to the topic, I will focus on the one necessary condition that must be satisfied before the Venezuelan economy can be turned around. Inflation must be stopped before stability can be established. Stability might not be everything, but everything is nothing without stability.

Title:Funding our future: Self determination delivering prosperity 
Abstract:The miracle of compound interest normally works against ordinary people, now it works for us - Once the savings policies outlined in this paper are fully mature, 95% plus of all New Zealanders will retire with 4-5 million dollars in their super fund accounts. No longer will New Zealanders get less out in pensions than the government takes in taxes. Old age will never be a reason for poverty again. Vets don’t have waiting lists, nor will New Zealanders when every New Zealander has a comprehensive catastrophic health policy ever year of their life. Patients with private insurance rarely have to queue. The policy outlined in this paper, gives you back your tax dollars, in a way that enables you to purchase your own insurance policy. Will once again become the route to advancement, when we cut out the middleman and let parents pay the school direct, then the school will get a dollar for every dollar spent on education. Real equality of opportunity gives the same spending power to everyone- and lets them choose their education. Choice in the educational system will raise our standards of achievement. Choice will give low-income families the same options as everyone else. Our shared home ownership model of housing will bring home ownership within the reach of everyone who works. Residential section development will be pushed to the maximum extent possible, and at reasonable prices. Being out of work for any reason an accident, being sick or unemployed, will all be covered by the same out of work welfare policy framework, ending any future attempts to fiddle the system. New Zealand’s one trillion dollars of unfunded welfare debt for health and pensions will disappear over time. Those years of living beyond our means will be behind us and taxes will drop as a consequence. The superannuation and health policies outlined in this paper will ensure that old age will never be a cause of poverty in New Zealand again. Far lower taxes allow workers to keep more of what they earn, much better incentives for people to work, better education and health policies will all help to lower poverty and keep it there. The lowest personal taxes in the world. That makes us one of the most attractive countries in the world.

Title:Human-Centred Economics: The Living Standards of Nations Author: Richard Samans Published in association with the International Labour Organization (ILO). By Richard Samans, Springer 2024 
Abstract:Richard Samans’s Human-Centred Economics offers a fundamental critique and structural reform of the prevailing liberal economic growth and development model. The book argues that modern economics has chronically underperformed in delivering social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and human resilience because of its nearly exclusive focus on Gross Domestic Product (GDP)—the wealth or production of nations. Tracing the problem not to the founding principles of classical political economy, but to a "wayward practice," Samans proposes restoring the discipline's dual focus. The core principle of "Human-Centred Economics" is that the median living standards of households must be a co-equal anchor of policy attention alongside GDP. To operationalize this, the author introduces an "aggregate distribution function," which formally integrates the institutional dimensions of a country’s social contract—including labor protection, financial governance, and environmental rules—into macroeconomic theory. The book frames this as a strategy to replace the "trickle-down" approach of neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus with a "Roosevelt Consensus". It details corresponding reforms for both domestic and international economic policy, arguing that governments have significant unexploited "policy space" to narrow their "welfare gap". Ultimately, the work seeks to strengthen market economies by institutionally hard-wiring inclusion, sustainability, and resilience, thereby charting a more viable, structural Middle Way that builds on the legacy of John Maynard Keynes.

Title:Unified Growth Theory contradicted by the absence of takeoffs in the Gross Domestic Product 
Abstract:Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. They demonstrate convincingly that the take offs from stagnation to growth, claimed in the Unified Growth Theory, never happened. This theory is again contradicted by the same data which were used, but never properly analysed, during its formulation. The absence of the claimed takeoffs demonstrates that the postulate of the differential takeoffs is also contradicted by data. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that the mathematically-analysable data contradict the concept of the prolonged Malthusian stagnation, its effects on the economic growth as well as the concept of a dramatic escape from the Malthusian trap.

Title:Reflections on Zimbabwe’s past and future: Tradeoffs between the Lexus and the Baobab Tree 
Abstract:This paper examines the ongoing economic challenges in Zimbabwe, particularly in the context of the government's post-2018 attempts to encourage foreign direct investment and achieve economic recovery. Despite an initial seemingly welcoming posture toward international business, persistent issues like continued land expropriations, chronic deficit spending, and severe liquidity shortages present formidable obstacles. The paper argues that the central impediment to sustainable growth is the persistent damage to property rights resulting from the post-2000 land reforms, which led to a catastrophic decline in agricultural output and necessitate food aid. Drawing on the metaphor of "The Lexus and the Baobab Tree"—representing globalized, efficient economic systems versus traditional, centralized culture—the analysis posits that Zimbabwe's current model resembles a "Baobab Tree economy," characterized by the export of crude, unprocessed commodities. This lack of economic complexity subjects the nation, especially its poorest citizens, to extreme volatility and risk from global commodity price swings, acting as a profound form of uncertainty. The paper critiques the move toward 99-year land leases as a flawed compromise, challenging the arguments of proponents who suggest these leases offer advantages over freehold titles in terms of "democratic accountability," "flexible land markets," and access to credit. Through comparison with Rwanda's impressive economic transformation—driven by substantial improvements in property rights and the business environment—the paper demonstrates that clear, secure property titles are fundamental to fostering a diversified, complex economy. Ultimately, the paper contends that freehold property titles are essential to unleash human creativity, diversify economic output, and provide a greater degree of economic stability and higher living standards for Zimbabweans, creating a necessary "insurance policy" against global shocks.

Title:The distributions in nature and entropy principle 
Abstract:The derivation of the maximum entropy distribution of particles in boxes yields two kinds of distributions: a "bell-like" distribution and a long-tail distribution. The first one is obtained when the ratio between particles and boxes is low, and the second one - when the ratio is high. The obtained long tail distribution yields correctly the empirical Zipf law, Pareto's 20:80 rule and Benford's law. Therefore, it is concluded that the long tail and the "bell-like" distributions are outcomes of the tendency of statistical systems to maximize entropy.

Title:Reviving Classical Liberalism Against Populism. By Nils Karlson, Springer 2024 
Abstract:Authored by Nils Karlson, this monograph, part of the Palgrave Studies in Classical Liberalism series, addresses the contemporary global rise of populism by advocating for a revival and reinterpretation of Classical Liberalism. The book operates from the premise that the core tenets of the liberal tradition—specifically epistemic independence from centralized power and respect for dispersed knowledge—have been neglected by overly rationalistic and constructivist approaches, leaving a vacuum that populism exploits. Karlson draws heavily on intellectual sources like the Scottish Enlightenment and Austrian economics, emphasizing the foundational importance of spontaneous order and evolved social norms over conscious political design or Socialist command. The analysis reframes classical liberal thought as the most robust intellectual defense against the populist challenge, which often relies on simplistic, centralized, and emotional appeals that undermine the dispersed nature of a modern civil society. The volume proposes a strategy of "Statecraft" and policy focused on leveraging these non-rationalistic, situated spontaneous orders to rebuild trust and fortify the institutions necessary to counteract populist movements.
