Title:  Economy and Art: Why are Economy and Art Closely Linked?
Abstract:  Most art products can be classified as intangible goods. They characterize a reasonable connection with passion, inspiration, creativity and emotions. However, the pricing of these outcomes is exceptional irregular and uncertain. As a result, the questions arise: What is art? What is the relationship between art and economy? Is there a practical way for artist to be famous and rich at the same time? Why are the fate of the artist depend not only on the quality and creativity of their products, but also to the economic resources?

Title:  Physical Infrastructures and Attractiveness of Private Capital in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) Countries
Abstract:  Physical infrastructures are a set of interconnected structural elements whose function is to participate in attracting capital flows in order for the economy to function efficiently. They transfer capital flows that are able to ensure growth and stability. They also constitute a major challenge for growth and development. We have attempted in this paper to study the influence of physical infrastructures and financial development on foreign direct investments (FDIs) in the context of Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries by combining two theoretical approaches (the Paradox of Lucas and the external-internal factors), and by integrating the correlation between the components of capital flows. Our regressions show the importance of non-linear effects in the explanation of the determinants of private capital. This analysis also emphasizes the more important role physical infrastructures play in attracting FDIs despite perverse effects.

Title:  Export Price Stability and Compatibility of Euro under the Export- Biased Productivity Growth in Turkey: A Criticism against the Maastricht Inflation Criterion
Abstract:  Football has become an important industry in Turkey. A huge amount of sponsoring, advertising, betting funds into football and television rights are sold for billions of Turkish Liras. In order to better compete in Turkish leagues, football clubs have made considerable investments and have aspired to be listed on the stock exchange. The pioneer was Be ikta  that went public in 2002. After that three football clubs were listed on Borsa Istanbul (BIST). The aim of this study is to evaluate the financial performance of four big football clubs (Be ikta , Fenerbah e, Galatasaray and Trabzonspor) listed on BIST from 2009-2010 to 2012-2013. In order to evaluate these clubs, Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is used. GRA is widely used in various disciplines such as economics, engineering, sociology and finance. It can be used as a rating, classification and decision making technique to determine the important factors among those required for a system with a limited number of data set.

Title:  An investigation of the corporate responsibility report assurance statements of the Big Four banks in Australia
Abstract:  The corporate responsibility report demonstrates an organisation s commitment to sustainability. Currently, not much is known about the quality of the assurance statements of the corporate responsibility reports of banks in Australia. This research study fills the gap in the literature by investigating the corporate responsibility report assurance statements of the Big Four banks in Australia. The assurance statements are evaluated against the criteria provided by O Dwyer and Owen (2005) and Perego and Kolk (2012). The results reveal that although the assurance statements, on average, meet the criteria highly, there are areas that need improvement.

Title:  Survey Effects of Oil Income on Nonoil Export Case Study: Iran
Abstract:  There are so much oil and gas reserves in Iran. Therefore extraction from these reserves and sell extracted oil and gas in international markets causes to high oil income for Iran. Especially in some years which oil price increases, our oil income was too high. In this paper, we want to reveal that, is high oil income caused to rise nonoil export? For this aim, we use from data of 1970-2013 and with Johansen co-integration test and Error Correction Model (ECM) extract short run and long run relations. Results of estimation reveal that in Iran high oil income did not cause to many non oil export in long run and short run. Therefore, we should allocate oil income to import industrial machines and reallocate them to agriculture and industrial sectors which causes to rise national production which will cause to high non oil export. Then, in this condition, our needy exchanges are provided from non oil export and our dependence to oil income will be declined.

Title:  Debt and Economic Growth: The Case of Japan
Abstract:  This article empirically examines whether or not public debt has an effect on economic growth in Japan. Public debt is becoming a concern all over the world. It is no longer a problem of developing countries but is becoming a serious problem for developed countries as well. In Japan, large accumulation of debtis now receiving much attention. This article focuses on the Japanese case of the relationship between public debt and growth. The results show indicate a negative relationship between public debt and economic growth in Japan, as in many existing studies. Moreover, openness of the economy is not related to economic growth. Debt should be avoided or the quantity should be reduced in future. Reduction of dependence on exportsand efforts to cut the debt is necessary to expand Japan s economy.

Title:  Veto Power and Wealth: Analysis of the Development of the Swiss Old Age Security
Abstract:  Switzerland was one of the last OECD-coun tries to introduce a program for old age security   the AHV. For many decades, expenditures both in absolute terms and as a portion of GDP remained low in OECD comparison. In the 1970ies however, expenditures exploded   within 10 years, the expenditures as a percentage of GDP doubled. This article explains this astonishing development by applying the veto player theory. Veto player theory is useful to determine changes in the policy stability. The higher the policy stability, the more difficult it is to move away from the political status quo. The lower the policy stability, the more pro bable it is that reforms and changes in government programs can be achieved. This article shows that the policy stability was particularly high in the constitution phase (from 1890 to 1947) and the consolidation phase (from 1974 to the present) and low in the phase in between (from 1948 to 1973), when the foundation for the expansion was set.

Title:  The Impact of Monetary policy on Consumption and Investment in Jordan during (1989-2013)
Abstract:  Monetary policy is one of the important monetary subjects that can evaluate the performance of the policy and its tools, recent development in financial markets in the past years led to changes in the behavior of countries monetary policies, concentrated to achieve stability in the price level by creating new ideas of how monetary policy affects the economy and its components through linking macroeconomic activities (private spending components) with nominal interest rate. This study aims to analyze and evaluate the impact of Jordanian monetary policy on consumption and investment spending during the period (1989-2013) to predict the impact of monetary policy and its instruments on real economic activities and inflation. The study finds that lending rate affects investment negatively but it does not affect consumption and real GDP in the short run. However, in the long run investment is affected by the co-movements occurred in consumption lending rate and lagged investment. Also, the study finds that real GDP is affected by the co- movements that occurred in real GDP and lending rate. Furthermore, domestic credit is affected by the co-movements that happened in domestic credit and lending rate.

Title:  Stock Prices and Exchange Rates Dynamics in South Africa: An application of Asymmetric Co-integration Approach
Abstract:  We applied asymmetric cointegration approach to investigate the impacts of stock prices on exchange rates in South Africa using monthly data from January 1980 to May 2014. The empirical finding shows that the two macroeconomic variables are cointegrated using traditional Engle-Granger approach. While TAR model shows no element of cointegration, MTAR model revealsthat there is long-run relationshipbetween the variables and they are asymmetrically cointegrated as signifies by both F-equality and F-joint respectively. Using Enders & Siklos (2001) table we reject null hypothesis of no cointegration at 5% significance level. This means that stock prices influences exchange rates in South Africa and the speed of adjustment is non-linear, when share price changes exchange rates equally changes but not in the same proportion with that of share prices. The policy implication is that the authorities in this country should focus more on stabilizing their exchange rates in relation to other major global currencies more especially American dollar. When the value of Rand continues to increase the economy will be less competitive internationally at the same time the value of the stocks might be unattractive even to international investors.

Title:  Assessing Fiscal Policy Cyclicality and Sustainability: A Fiscal Reaction Function for Kenya
Abstract:  This study sought to determine whether fiscal policy for Kenya is on a sustainable path by estimating a fiscal reaction function.   A fiscal reaction function is a rule derived from an inter-temporal government budget constraint which reveals the response of government to accumulating public debt. It also sought to establish whether fiscal policy responds to business cycles by determining its cyclical nature. The study used annual time series data spanning 1970 to 2013 and multivariate analysis was based on VAR and VECM model. The empirical analysis reveals that, firstly fiscal behavior is incoherent with inter-temporal budget constraint and the moderation is low. This implies that if fiscal adjustment is not done, debt is likely to accumulate. Secondly, election cycles expenditures threaten Kenya s long run fiscal sustainability. Finally, fiscal policy is a-cyclical meaning that stabilization objective is not considered while conducting the fiscal policy. The study recommends that fiscal rules, independent fiscal committee and comprehensive fiscal regulations laws should be enacted to correct these biases.

Title:  Zhaoguang Hu, Xinyanh Han, & Quan Wern, Integrated Resource Strategic Planning and Power Demand-Side Management
Abstract:  The edited volume presents an engaging cartography of Indian economy following two decades of liberalization on the backdrop of globalization and problem of sustainability - two defining moments of post-reforms reorganization of the economy. A wide variety of sector-specific and economy-wide studies in the collection, examine the central tenets of market-centric reforms representing globalization. The research works dealing with micro- and macro-aspects of development help us form an idea of important issues, emerging debates, dominant institutions and changes required for attainment/restoration of efficiency. Most of these writings indicate the limitations of current developmental logic in their specific settings. These studies also propose measures to tackle the problems faced while presuming growth-sustainability disconnect to be temporary in nature. A number of studies introduced new analytical categories and empirical frameworks to capture current reality in better and more meaningful ways. A third strand of writings portrays conflict between the project of globalization and issue of sustainability as a distinguishing characteristic of global capitalism although the present policy framework accord highest priority to capitalist expansion. This conflict however, has put the Indian state in a perpetual act of balancing the growth objective of global capital and welfare objective meant for those experiencing exclusion in the development process.

Abstract:  The book that consists of 240 pages including the bibliography and contains the following sections and chapters; The Foreword: This contains a few brief remarks regarding the philosophy of science and philosophy of economics. The remarks are, in principle, both relevant and appropriate in terms of the  general principles  with regard to science, the science of economics, the nature of science as well as the duties of a scientist. The author s remarks underline that  neoclassical economics  which is widely acknowledged as the school that economics seems to represent, is, in fact, a more  ideological model  than a true scientific and realistic basis for economics and, in fact, favors the  dominant classes  in the society.

Title:  Labor-Capital Conflict: From Eurocentric Capitalism Towards. A Humanistic World Order
Abstract:  What Wells summarized in the first quote above was Eurocentric capitalism. It has now become the principal source of instability and inequality in the world. Speculation, not profit, is its driver; profit has taken a back-seat. Capital market, the arena for speculation, is disconnected from the real economy, particularly the labor market which rewards less and less the workers and producers. Rewards, as private wealth are increasingly in speculative capital gains which accrue to the top 1% elite, made up of stock market players and financial institutions, while the rest [workers, middle class and those in lower segments of the socio-economic pyramid] fall behind.

Title:  Private Consumption in Sweden and Finland Before, During and After the Global Financial Crisis
Abstract:  This study describes private consumption in Sweden and Finland before, during and after the Global Financial crisis. During eleven years, from 2004 to 2013, we investigate how the total household consumption expenditures have developed and how households have allocated their consumption budgets on various consumption categories in the two Nordic countries. The research design is of descriptive character and the data is derived from Statistics Finland and Statistics Sweden. The key findings of the study are: (1) The private consumption continued to grow in both countries, with the exception in Finlandin 2009. (2) Both the actual decrease in consumption and the reallocation of commodities indicate that Finnish households have suffered more from the Global Financial Crisis compared to Swedish ones.

Title:  Income Distribution and the 2008-2012 Economic Crisis: The Latin American Experience
Abstract:  This paper analyses the financial and economic crises that had a differentiated impact in the Latin-American region, depending on the ability of some countries to keep up an aggregate demand -i.e., through redistribution devices like the degree of integration held within the foreign financial sector. Based on a sample of regional economies, and working over a period spanning from 2000 to 2013, we found that countries with a relatively better income distribution and domestic financial systems connected with credit programs supporting consumption and investment, had had a better economic performance than those countries with a strong linkage to the international financial system, given that the crisis was ignited at the banking system and accelerated by the same mechanism over-spreading negative shock effects on their capacity to offset them and, in doing so, try an economic recovery. Finally, the authors raise some hints to devise correct policy changes to deal in the still aftermath of the crises in Latin America from a post Keynesian perspective.

Title:  The role of Services in Enhancing Indian Manufacturing Exports: A Firm Level Analysis, 2000-01 to 2011-12
Abstract:  In this paper, we try to examine and assess the contribution of services towards India s manufacturing exports at the firm level. In other words, the role of services in shaping the international competiveness of the Indian Manufacturing Sector at the firm level is examined. Services are instrumental in connecting to the world market and can help firms to differentiate their products. However, only bits and pieces of the relation between services and exports have been analyzed in the earlier literature. Most of the earlier studies relating to services have explored the link between services and Total Factor Productivity. The relation between services and exports has not been explored at the firm level in case of India. This also gives a justification for conducting the present study. With now firm level databases available, it allows us to explore this part in details. For exploring this link, the firm level data was collected from the Centre for Monitoring of The Indian Economy (Prowess Database) for the years 2000-01 to 2011-12. The Manufacturing firms had used different types of services according to their needs and the expenditure for the all the different services were not the same. The expenses incurred by the manufacturing firms for services like business services, repairs and maintenance,  Professional services, Research & Development and others etc. were added together to get total expenses on the services variable. Two alternative econometric methods (Panel Regression method and Tobit model) were used in our study. The findings confirm that services have contributed to enhanced export competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing firms.  The paper looks at the firm specific factors like firm size, age, previous years export performance, group versus non-group, labor productivity and services that affected the export performance of the Indian manufacturing firms. The overall results show that the firm specific factors such as firm size, extent of use of services, group versus non-group firms, and previous years export performance played a positive role in improving the Indian manufacturing exports.

Title:  Causality Relationship between Money, Income, Price and Exchange Rates in a Small Open Economy: the Case of Hong Kong
Abstract:  This paper investigates the direction of causation among income, price, exchange rates and money supply in Hong Kong. We use the Granger(1969, 1980) causality concept to find the existence of such a relationship. The paper presents the results of two separate bivariate analyses: on involving money and income, and the other involving money and exchange rates. A notable result to come out of the paper is that there is no causality relationship between them.

Title:  Vani K Borooah & Colin Knox, The Economics of Schooling in a Divided Society: The Case for Shared Education
Abstract:  Our identity is defined by the stories we tell about the past and the stories that we suppress. Segregation in schooling by religion at an early age inculcates a narrative of identity that excludes the other. That is not helpful for either peace or prosperity. This book discusses one aspect of the peace process in a conflict society, Northern Ireland, which is attempting to break the circle of violence. The authors examine the potential benefits of integrated education.

Title:   rn B. Bodvarsson & Hendrik Van den Berg, The Economics of Immigration: Theory and Policy
Abstract:  The Economics of Immigration: Theory and Policy (Second edition)is designed as a survey book that addresses all facets of immigration. Though there is a great amount of information regarding immigration, the complexity of the topic has resulted in an absence of any comprehensive book the covers a wide range of issues. The book covers immigration theory, empirical evidence regarding those theories, special issues in immigration, and immigration policy throughout the world. Designed as a resource for both graduate students and researchers in the field, this book is successful at compiling all of the various literature and policy on immigration in a cohesive manner.

Title:  Mathematical Analysis of the Historical Economic Growth with a Search for Takeoffs from Stagnation to Growth
Abstract:  Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. Included in the analysis is the world and regional economic growth. The analysis demonstrates that historical economic growth had a natural tendency to follow hyperbolic distributions. Parameters describing hyperbolic distributions have been determined. A search for takeoffs from stagnation to growth produced negative results. This analysis throws a new light on the interpretation of the mechanism of the historical economic growth and suggests new lines of research.

Title:  The Impact of Governance Environment on Economic Growth: The Case of Middle Eastern and North African Countries
Abstract:  The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the impact of governance on economic growth using a group of 188 countries. Although our main focus is on the 21 Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries, our findings can be applied to the other countries as well. There are two main contributions in this paper. The first contribution is we are able to create a  composite governance index  (CGI) that summarizes the existing six governance measurements; the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), using the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) method. The first principal component derived from the WGIs explains as large as 81% of the variations in the original six WGI measurements, which indicates that it can be used as a strong indicator for evaluating government s managerial ability and effectiveness. Following the creation of CGI, the second contribution is we are able to quantify the marginal contribution of improvement in governance to economic performance using PPP adjusted constant per capita GDP data. We find that the per capita GDP would rise by about 2% if the CGI increases by one unit. Using the Rule of 70, the marginal estimate further indicates a mere five-unit improvement in CGI would double the country s per capita GDP in seven years. Nonetheless, the effect of improvement of governance can not account for the higher than expected per capita GDP in most of the oil rich MENA countries. In other words, the majority of the MENA countries have achieved fragile levels of economic growth that does not depend on sound governance.

Title:  Military Spending and Economic Growth in Greece and the Arms Race between Greece and Turkey
Abstract:  One of the most important reasons that led Greece to the current macroeconomic instability is the high military spending during the last decades. Thus, it is necessary to examine the impact of military spending on economic growth for the case of Greece. Furthermore, it will be very useful to examine the arms race hypothesis between Greece and Turkey in order to identify if there is an interaction between these countries that leads to the high level of military spending. In this paper we empirically test the relationship between military spending and economic growth for Greece and Turkey during 1957-2013, and examine the validity of arms race hypothesis between the two countries. We deployed unit root tests, unit root tests with structural changes, cointegration techniques and finally Granger causality tests. Granger causality tests in the case of Greece and Turkey imply that the causality runs from military spending to economic growth, however we find that there is no evidence of causality between Greek and Turkish military spending, which mean that that these countries act independently.

Title:  Real Effective Exchange Rates Comovements and the South African Currency
Abstract:  The study analyses comovement between the real effective exchange rate of South Africa and those of a sample of countries that include the world s major economies as well as emerging and developing economies. The comovement is examined over the short and long term as well as pre and post the recent global financial crisis. The results show that, although the real effective exchange rate of South Africa shows some comovement with those of the selected countries, such comovement is mixed and inconsistent. Currencies that belong to a similar grouping in terms of economic development and geographical location display both positive and negative comovement with the real effective exchange rate of South Africa. There is also no consistency in the comovement between the real effective exchange rate of South Africa and those of the selected countries pre and post the recent financial crisis. The results further show that the comovement between the real effective exchange rate of South Africa and those of some of the selected sample of countries is stronger between the trend component than it is between the cyclical component.

Title:  The Path-Dependence Bias in Approximating Local Price Levels by CPIs
Abstract:  Lacking data on price levels across locations, economists are forced to proxy them. One method is to extrapolate the price levels known for locations in some point in time to another point by multiplying the initial price levels by the local CPIs. With the use of simulation experiments, this paper demonstrates that such a method is inadequate, since the path dependence of CPI alone produces considerable biases distorting cross-location comparisons of price levels.

Title:  New Result in Consumption Theory:Change in Savings and Income Growth   Nineteen Years Later
Abstract:  This new version uses the definitions and some of the results found in Sargent s Macroeconomic Theory. Hall s (1978) proof of the corollary 4,ct+1 = ct, can be found in Flavin (1981).  Writing the same consumption stated in Flavin, for period t+1, in a different way for the summation of the expected future incomes, it is possible to show that changes in savings is a function of income growth.  This new result has implications, for instance, in Keynes  (1936) saving and dissaving.

Title:  Micro Enterprise Financing in an Islamic Economic Framework: Bangladesh Perspective
Abstract:  The paper studies the deficiency of the neo liberal policy agenda that aims totransform non-governmental organization (NGOs) engaged in poverty alleviationinto formal financial institutions seeking access to capital market and performingon a commercial basis. It propounds that poverty focused credit programs aimedat distributive equity are logically inconsistent with an ethically neutral liberal marketorder. In comparison, it is inferred in the paper that Islamic economic principles affirm the logical consistency and adequacy to reality of Islamicfinancial program and poverty focused credit programs. These programs, as indicated by the welfare banking ofIslamic Banks in Bangladesh, seek access to financialmarkets, which are characterized by the presence of Shariah instrument prohibiting interest and profiteering and promoting charity.

Title:  The Relationship Between Consumption and Income
Abstract:  Friedman (1957) states that permanent consumption is a function of permanent income in the long-run. Co-integration theory is first used to test whether a long-run equilibrium relation exists between the two variables. The existence of an error-correction form between two variables is necessary and sufficient for them to be cointegrated. We applied for an error-correction form to conform the linear long-run relationship between permanent income and permanent consumption under special conditions and the elasticity of permanent income in logarithms with respect to permanent consumption in logarithms is unity.

Title:  Causal Link between Trade, Political Instability, FDI and Economic Growth   Nigeria Evidence
Abstract:  The current liberal policies adopted by the government in Nigeria since 1986 provided a stronger bilateral ties which continue to spring up between Nigeria and other participating trading partners, hence trade and foreign direct investment continue to increase noticeably on oil and gas sector. Nigeria continues to emerge as one of the biggest hubs for trade and investment in Africa while the free flow of FDI is expected to contribute and increase the exports rate. The last two decades witnessed numerous trade reforms, which has given more liberal export favorable surroundings. The pace of FDI is greater than the growth at international level, which would enhance grandness rational behind FDI inflow with the volume of trade and goods, as well as the possible effect of FDI inflow on the economic growth in Nigeria while not neglecting the likely effect of political instability that might pose to a major threat to foreign investors. An attempt is made to investigate the causal nexus between FDI inflow, volume of trade, political instability index, and Gross Domestic Product in Nigeria within the period of 1981 to 2012 using co-integration analysis and multivariate Granger causality. Multivariate Granger causality test is carried out using VECM approach to analyze the causal links among all the variables considered for estimation. A bi-directional causality was discovered between FDI inflow and economic growth (GDP); however there is one  way direction between political instability and FDI, between political instability and GDP. Moreover, there is also one  way relationship between FDI and volume of trade within the period of study.

Title:  The Impact of Capital Expenditure on the Probability of Reelection of Mayors at the District Level in Peru
Abstract:  Until recently, elected authorities in Peru were allowed to run for re-election. The objective of this study is to test whether voters reward (or punish) elected authorities according to expenditure performance. In particular, I measure the probability of a mayor being reelected subject to their capital expenditure throughout the four-year term. I study the two most recent electoral terms: 2006-2010 and 2010-2014. To deal with the endogeneity of capital expenditure, the model controls for a number of characteristics of the elected authority and his or her political party (including the share of voted obtained in the previous election), for district characteristics and for other characteristics of the municipality. I find that mayors who get reelected for another four-year termare characterized by high levels of capital expenditure throughout the periods of 2007-2010 and 2011-2014. In particular, the years before the electoral processes, 2009 and 2013, seem to be of vital importance to determine the outcome of an election. A more refined question is answered by looking at both timing and type of expenditure which reveals that the electorate values the provision of public goods such as security, electrification, education, health and roads during the electoral term. Voters tend to punish projects related totransportation, communications and plumbing, which are characterized by the destruction of roads in the electoral years.

Title:  The Effect of Country Risk on Foreign Direct Investment: A Dynamic Panel Data Analysis for Developing Countries
Abstract:  Issues created by inconsistency make difficult for investors to make healthy decisions. Risks and uncertainty may lead investors to have bad decisions which result in low level of profit from investments. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of country risk on the direct foreign investments (FDI). In the study in which annual data between the years of 2002 and 2014 belong to 49 countries are utilized, the relationships between the variables are analyzed through two phase system-GMM dynamic panel method. Three model assumptions are made for the study. According to the assumption results of the first model which focus on the country risk s effect on the FDI inflows; the decrease in the country risk increases the FDI inflows. The results of second model through which the effects of sub elements of country risk (financial, economic and political risk) on the FDI are analyzed separately show that financial risk does not create statistically meaningful effect while the decrease in economic and political risk affects the FDI inflows in positive means. Finally, according to the results of the third model which focus on the effect of FDI inflows on the country risks; FDI creates a decreasing effect for country risk and indirectly inconsistencies.

Title:  Marcel Boumans, Science Outside the Laboratory: Measurement in Field Science and Economics
Abstract:  Marcel Boumans  Science outside the Laboratory revolves around the distinction between laboratory and field science, and the challenges that the latter faces in the measurement of scientific phenomena. Boumans raises a methodological puzzle, the possibility of reliable measurement in the field, and he gradually resolves it throughout an excursus in the history of science that brings to light episodes of methodological significance. The book starts with Oskar Morgenstern s warning about the peril of scientific observation in economics; touches upon Gaussian s theory of error and its uses in meteorology; discusses Haavelmo s intuition about the problem of passive observation; and concludes with a survey of contemporary methods for aggregating experts  judgments. Ultimately, Science outside the Laboratory  is a call for expert knowledge as a complementary source of evidence that, if carefully integrated with the traditional tools of field sciences, can eventually lead us to more reliable, and in this sense more objective, measurement. In what follows, I will first outline what I take to be the main theses of the book and discuss some of its main tenets. I will then illustrate some of the crucial steps in Boumans  argument in detail. I will finally conclude with some general comments about the book.

Title:  Did Keynes Make His Case?
Abstract:  Paper considers Keynes  case for fiscal stimulus under depression conditions   a case that remains prominent in both policy and academic literature.  It highlights four specific real-history instances where, Keynes argued, monetary measures alone would not have restored prosperity and, hence, where fiscal activism would have been desirable.  These were: 1) the depression of the 1890s; 2) the onset of the Great Depression in 1930; 3) the Roosevelt Recovery in 1933; and 4) the 1937-38 contraction in the US.  But evidence from all four instances, gathered here, undermines Keynes  claims...  Paper then shifts to Keynes  theoretical rationale, where it turns out that the frequently-cited  liquidity trap  argument was only one of several he advanced for monetary policy ineffectiveness.  And it was not the one he most-often emphasized, while his own texts raise doubt about its coherence.  Keynes view of Depression was intertwined with the stagnationist temper of economic theory during the middle 1930s, and with his cultural and aesthetic distaste for  capitalist individualism.   The weakness of Keynes  real-history illustrations reflects in part Keynes  flawed underlying critique of  classical  theory   a critique that, because it was so prominent, has often set back understanding.  Keynes did not make his case.

Title:  Disaggregated Credit Extension and Financial Distress in South Africa
Abstract:  This study analyses the relationship between disaggregated credit extension and financial distress in South Africa. Of particular interest is to isolate the components of disaggregated credit extension that show a strong relationship with the measure of financial distress. The empirical results reveal that aggregate total domestic credit extension is robustly positively correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress, while there is a mixed relationship between the components of disaggregated credit extension and the composite indicator of financial distress. In particular, the study finds that total domestic credit extension, instalment sale credit, loans and advances to households, investments and total loans and advances are highly correlated with the composite indicator of financial distress. Therefore,the study conjures that these components could be aggregated into a single measure of credit extension that could be usedfor financial stability purposes in South Africa.

Title:  Puzzling Properties of the Historical Growth Rate of Income Per Capita Explained
Abstract:  Galor discovered many mysteries of the growth process. He lists them in his Unified Growth Theory and wonders how they can be explained. Close inspection of his mysteries reveals that they are of his own creation. They do not exist. One of his claimed mysteries is the mystery of the alleged sudden spurt in the growth rate of income per capita and in the growth of population. This sudden spurt never happened. Precisely the same data, which were used in support of the Unified Growth Theory are in fact in its direct contradiction. They show that the created mysteries of growth do not exist. The difference between the diametrically opposite conclusions is that in order to support the Unified Growth Theory and to create the mysteries of growth data were appropriately manipulated and distorted but the contradicting evidence is based on their rigorous analysis. The mechanism of the historical economic growth and of the growth of human population is yet to be explained but it would be unproductive to try to look for explanations in the Unified Growth Theory. However, the problem is much deeper than just the examination of this theory. Demographic Growth Theory is based on the incorrect but deeply entrenched postulates developed by accretion over many years and now generally accepted in the economic and demographic research, postulates revolving around the concept of Malthusian stagnation and around a transition from stagnation to growth. The study presented here and earlier similar publications show that these postulates need to be replaced by interpretations based on the mathematical analysis of data and on the correct understanding of hyperbolic distributions.

Title:  The Cost of Low Inflation in Case of Pakistan
Abstract:  It is a debatable issue that high and variable inflation causes the well fare loss while on the other side reducing inflation generally has some cost and the amount of that cost is measured by the sacrifice ratio. Therefore inflation output trade off is important for central banks when formulating policy. Sacrifice ratio is the main indicator to measure the real cost of disinflation, calculated as the ratio of the cumulative percentage output loss (the difference between actual and potential output) to the size of disinflation. Thus, the sacrifice ratio measures the real output cost per unit of permanent decrease in inflation. Sacrifice ratio is basically divided into two main categories, time invariant sacrifice ratio and episode specific sacrifice ratio. In time invariant sacrifice ratio we took Philips Curve, structural VAR and in episode specific ratio we took Ball method of sacrifice ratio and Zhang method of sacrifice ratio. We found positive sacrifice ratio in almost all the methods but the magnitude of the sacrifice ratio is not large and the estimates of sacrifice ratio are sensitive to different estimation method.

Title:  Are Constitutional States Able to Drive the Global Technological Change?
Abstract:  The present paper aims at assessing the possible efficiency of the principle of national contributions, assumed in the 2015 Paris Framework Convention on Climate Change. Strong historical evidence indicates that any significant development of constitutional states used to take place, in the past, on the rising tide of demographic growth. Presently, we are facing global demographic slowdown, and contesters argue that constitutional states are not the right address to write to if we want breakthrough technological change. This paper assumes that the capacity of constitutional states to carry out the obligations declared in the Framework Convention, i.e. to carry out deep technological changes in the global economy, depends on their economic power, which can be estimated as their capacity to appropriate capital. Empirical data, examined in this article, indicates that since the 1980s, constitutional states have been losing their economic power, and that the overall technological progress is more and more disconnected from that economic power of governments. Moreover, constitutional states seem to be losing their capacity to experiment with their own institutions.

Title:  Equity Forecast: Predicting Long Term Stock Price Movement using Machine Learning
Abstract:  Long term investment is one of the major investment strategies. However, calculating intrinsic value of some company and evaluating shares for long term investment is not easy, since analyst have to care about a large number of financial indicators and evaluate them in a right manner. So far, little help in predicting the direction of the company value over the longer period of time has been provided from the machines. In this paper we present a machine learning aided approach to evaluate the equity s future price over the long time. Our method is able to correctly predict whether some company s value will be 10% higher or not over the period of one year in 76.5% of cases.

Title:  Economic Progress as Related Sets of Non-Repeating Eclipses
Abstract:  I use a seemingly simple analogy of lunar and solar eclipses and set theoretical language to characterize how objects (factors) and ideas (forces) have determined the course of economic progress. In the early Ages economic progress depended heavily on objects, i.e., objects eclipsed ideas. From the end of Classical Antiquity to the present, objects, ideas, and their interactions and intra-actions have driven economic progress. The future of economic progress would depend principally on ideas, not because objects would vanish, but because object productivity would increasingly depend on ideas. While the welfare implications of the full idea eclipse of objects are difficult to pin down, they are not inconceivable. One obvious outcome is that different regions and countries will continue to perform differently because ideas will remain unevenly distributed, and even when they are evenly distributed, they will not be equally productive in all places. Such a policy implication recommends more investment in ideas than in objects in order to close the gaps in economic progress across regions and countries.

Title:  An Alternative Framework for Time Series Decomposition and Forecastingand its Relevance for Portfolio Choice   A Comparative Study of the Indian Consumer Durable and Small Cap Sectors
Abstract:  One of the challenging research problems in the domain of time series analysis and forecasting is making efficient and robust prediction of stock market prices. With rapid development and evolution of sophisticated algorithms and with the availability of extremely fast computing platforms, it has now become possible to effectively extract, store, process and analyze high volume stock market time series data. Complex algorithms for forecasting are now available for speedy execution over parallel architecture leading to fairly accurate results. In this paper, we have used time series data of the two sectors of the Indian economy - Consumer Durables sector and the Small Cap sector for the period January 2010 - December 2015 and proposed a decomposition approach for better understanding of the behavior of each of the time series. Our contention is that various sectors reveal different time series patterns and understanding them is essential for portfolio formation. Further, based on this structural analysis, we have also proposed several robust forecasting techniques and analyzed their accuracy in prediction using suitably chosen training and test data sets. Extensive results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our propositions.

Title:  Analysis of the Unanticipated Factors in Portfolio Inflows to Indonesia: A SVAR Approach: 2001-2012
Abstract:  After the 2008 global economic crisis, as one of the emerging markets, Indonesia has experienced a lot of capital inflows. The increase in capital inflows has stimulated economic activities and caused macroec onomic fluctuations. This study focuses on the analysis of pull and push factors that affect the portfolio capital inflows to Indonesia. The study utilizes structural vector autoregressive (SVAR), impulse responses function (IRF), and variance decomposition (VD) methods.  The method of SVAR is used to analyze the shocks to factors relatively affecting the variation of incoming portfolio inflows (equity and bond inflows) to Indonesia, as well as the responses of the portfolio inflows to shocks to these factors. The findings indicate that SVAR approach can be employed in this study. The results of the impulse responses functions show that the portfolio inflows in the form of bonds generate positive response to the unexpected changes of budget deficit and domestic output growth, while the portfolio inflows in the form of stocks generate positive response to the unexpected changes in foreign output growth, domestic output growth, stock price index, and budget deficit. Furthermore, the results of variance decomposition analysis indicate that domestic interest rate and current account balance are the main determinants that explained the variation of portfolio inflows in the form of bonds, while the domestic interest rate and stock price index are the most dominant variables that explained the variation of portfolio inflows in the form of stocks.

Abstract:  Professor R gnvaldur Hannesson, an authority on natural resource management, has written a well-argued, even if polemical, book against ecofundamentalism, which, for him, puts nature before man. He cogently discusses the difficulties in applying notions of sustainability and biodiversity to the human condition and suggests that in the foreseeable future mankind should continue mainly to use fossil fuels as energy sources. Hannesson regards models of global warming as scientific, but as too uncertain for mankind radically to alter its way of life.

Title:  Peter Murphy, Universities and Innovation Economies: The Creative Wasteland of Post-Industrial Society
Abstract:  This is a brilliant, indeed an indispensable book. It provides a compelling diagnosis of the decline and failure of the contemporary bureaucratic and managerially governed university, the post-industrial-bureaucratic driven economy, and the social-liberal-democratic-bureaucratic state. It deals with matters that those of us who work in universities, particularly in Australia and the United Kingdom (US universities are still far less centralized), and who know from the inside that so much of what has happened over the last thirty years or so has pretty well destroyed the university as a place for reading, reflection, discussion, dispute,  deliberation, and inventive imaginative responses to what are thrown up by the spirits of the times. But what makes the book truly remarkable is the thoroughness of the diagnosis and the mountains of evidence that the book marshals to make its case. Moreover, both the diagnosis and the evidence that is summoned to confirm the diagnosis could only have been made by someone who effortlessly moves between the disciplinary compartmentalisations, which, when kept separate, only serve to dilute any diagnosis of the nature of the problems and the forces and interests that conspire not only to create the problems but, sadly, to make then insoluble. Murphy is, to use one of those buzz-words that usually smacks of  bureaucratise ,  multi-skilled  - precisely because he exemplifies that combination that is, sadly, all too rarely to be found, let alone nurtured in universities today: he is a real scholar, a prodigious researcher, and an inventive thinker.

Abstract:  We present an analysis about subsidy policy for adoption of new technology in duopoly with differentiated goods under absolute and relative profit maximization. Technology itself is free, however, firms must expend fixed set-up costs to adopt new technology. There are various cases about optimal policies depending on the level of the set-up cost and whether the goods of the firms are substitutes or complements. In particular, under relative profit maximization there is a case such that the social welfare is maximized when one firm adopts new technology, but no firm adopts new technology without subsidy. Then, the government should give a subsidy to only one firm. It is a discriminatory policy. The government gives a chance to receive a subsidy to only one firm.

Title:  Scientifically Unacceptable Established Knowledge in Demography and in Economic Research
Abstract:  The established knowledge in demography and in the economic research is based on the concept of Malthusian stagnation and on the associated concept of the escape from the Malthusian trap. These two fundamental concepts were gradually enforced by numerous other related postulates all aimed at explaining the mechanism of the historical growth of population and of the historical economic growth. Examples of publications based on the established knowledge are closely examined. They are used to show why the established knowledge is scientifically unacceptable. It is also pointed out that the established knowledge is contradicted by data and by their analyses. Interpretations of the historical economic growth and of the historical growth of population has to be based on accepting hyperbolic growth. However, the discussed examples point to a more serious problem in these two fields of research. It is a fundamental systemic problem, the problem associated with the way research is conducted. Doctrines, interpretations and declarations used by the established knowledge have to be accepted by faith. Data are either ignored or manipulated to support preconceived ideas. Contradicting evidence is methodically ignored.  To be recognised as science, demographic and economic research has to adhere to the scientific rules of investigation.

Title:  A Literature Review of Behavioural Finance
Abstract:  The efficient market hypothesis and behavioural finance theory have been the cornerstone of modern asset pricing for the past 50 odd years. Although both theories are fundamental in explaining modern asset pricing, they are opposing views. The efficient market hypothesis dictates that the price of any asset depends on the information, while the behavioural finance theory dictates that the price depends on the reaction of the market participants to the information. Therein lays the key to the argument influencing modern asset pricing, does price immediately reflect the information or market participants  perception of the information. In this paper, we will critical evaluate the theories influencing the behavioural finance theory. We will review the overreaction/underreaction hypothesis and rational bubbles arguments influencing the behavioural finance theory. In concluding, we find that although the behavioural finance theory has difficulties in testing and the empirical evidence is mixed. Yet it does explain a number of anomalies in the financial world and is a more accurate view of the real world.  It is also possible to explain market efficiency using the underreaction/overreaction hypothesis. However, a key advantage of using the efficient market hypothesis is that it is a useful benchmark for regulators and central bankers alike. The lack of a uniformed testable model means that the behavioural finance theory as it stands cannot be used as a benchmark. Conversely, the key to the behavioural finance theory is in its ability to explain the movement from the benchmark. So in essence, both models are required to explain asset pricing.

Title:  Mexican Hat Wavelet Mathematical Formula Applied to Business and Economics
Abstract:  The Mexican hat wavelet mathematical formula is used in physics, music, and earthquake prediction to allow different equations to equal because the wavelet can approximate the exogenous and the endogenous variables. This spontaneous symmetry breaking equation can have applications to business and economics akin to the game theory Nash equation that enabled companies to provide yields to financial instruments without necessarily go through a zero sum equation scenario. This research will allow the economics and finance practioners to apply the model to their respective disciplines to be able to draw the different uses in business and economics in particular risk analysis.

Title:  Determinants of Export Performance in Tanzania
Abstract:  Tanzania has been experiencing a persistent balance of trade deficit since the 1970s. This paper examines factors affecting export performance in Tanzania during the 1966-2015 period by employing Johansen cointegration and Granger causality approach. The Error Correction Modeling is employed to estimate the model. Based on the findings of cointegration approach the paper reveals that there is a stable long-run relationship between the series. Results suggest that economic real per capita GDP, trade liberalization, and exchange rate have a positive impact on export performance in Tanzania. The results also reveal that exports and official development assistance are negatively associated in the economy of Tanzania. Furthermore, the paper establishes the direction of causality between exports and economic growth. The results on this causal relationship suggest that real per capita GDP causes exports and not otherwise. This implies that that policies geared towards real per capita GDP should be given first priority if export trend is to be enhanced over time. Notwithstanding, from a policy point of view the macroeconomic instability is supported by the findings as inflation has a negative impact on exports. Increases inflation in the exporting economy than importing economy causes exports to become more expensive, resulting in a decline in exports.

Title:  Forty Defective Criticisms of Full Reserve Banking
Abstract:  The basics of full reserve banking (FR) are set out below, followed by forty defective criticisms of FR. Each of those forty sections has: 1. A heading. 2. Where the heading does not adequately capture the nature of the criticism, there is a paragraph below the heading starting  I.e  , which expands on the heading. 3. There are references to one or more economists who have put the relevant criticism. 4. The answer to each criticism which starts with a paragraph beginning with the word  Answer.  And finally, this work is an updated version of Musgrave (2014). About 90% of the content of this and the latter work are the same. Abbreviations used are thus. CB refers to  Central bank  and PB refers to private bank. The term  commercial bank  would be more accurate than private bank since a commercial bank can perfectly well be publically owned. But the words central and commercial unfortunately both begin with  c . Thus the term  private bank  is arguably better. The word bank on its own refers to a PB.

Title:  Religion, Economy, and State: Economic Thought of al-Mawardi in Adab al-Dunya wa-al-Din
Abstract:  The relation between religion, economy and the country became a major topic in the development of public welfare systems. Humans are political creatures that have the potential to realise the level of moral conscience to meet the needs of a better life, but humans as spiritual beings must have a balance between religious morality and economic morality. With economic ethics are supported by religious morality, the welfare system can be realised systemically if the state, communities and individuals can realise the six-dimensional form: religious observance, good governance, justice, national security, the prosperity of society and the nation's vision.

Title:  Pulin B. Nayak, Economic Development of India
Abstract:  The paradigm shift in economic policy in the 1990s elicited a tremendous interest in the pace and pattern of economic development of India. Indian economic policies as also the process of her development is being closely monitored and written about by academics, global institutions, think tanks, media, political analysts and civil society within and outside the country. The development issues of erstwhile British colonies did not attract adequate academic attention for the most part of the twentieth century. A four volume compendium of 75 papers giving a comprehensive account of the development process of the Indian economy by Pulin Nayak is a timely and valuable contribution to the pool of studies being carried out on India in different parts of the globe. Introduction to the four volume book reflects the scholarship of the author, which will be of immense academic value to anyone who is interested in the historical backdrop of the development path chosen by the Indian leaders after Independence of the country in 1947. It builds on the discourse of development economics for low income countries.

Title:  How Trade Facilitation Measures influence Export Orientation? Empirical Estimates with Logistics Performance Index Data
Abstract:  With inception of a comprehensive WTO framework in 1995, while the tariff barriers across Member countries have declined, several procedural and policy-related hassles still continue to obstruct trade flows. To reduce the procedural hassles to export and import flows, from the Cancun Ministerial (2003) onwards, negotiations to reach an agreement on Trade Facilitation (TF) started, which was finally concluded at the Bali Ministerial (2013) meeting of the WTO. The current analysis explores the relationship between TF measures, as reflected from the World Bank Logistics Performance Index (LPI),and export orientation (export as percentage of GDP) during four years, namely 2007, 2010, 2012 and 2014. The empirical results underline the difference in the influence of TF on export orientation in higher-income and lower-income countries. It is concluded that there is need to continue the  Aid-for-Trade  support measures to lower-income economies, for improving their TF scenario.

Title:  What DCC-GARCH model tell us about the effect of the gold price s volatility on south african exchange rate?
Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to study through a model rarely used and little known, the effect of the gold price s volatility on the south african real exchange rate. More precisely, it is to show that, through the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) GARCH model; we get results that are consistent with economic works (Frankel, 2007) on the relationship between gold price s volatility and the real exchange rate. The period retained in this research paper going from May 1995 to April 2014 and the frequency of the data is monthly. After analysis, we find that in the short term, the real exchange rate is more sensitive to its own volatility, compared to the effect of the volatility of gold price. This last effect, although high, is less persistent on the real exchange rate.

Abstract:  There is a conception that Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics cannot yield the long tail distribution. This is the justification for the intensive research of nonextensive entropies (i.e. Tsallis entropy and others). Here the error that caused this misconception is explained and it is shown that a long tail distribution exists in equilibrium thermodynamics for more than a century.

Title:  Understanding  Shared Valued  and Social Capital Link to Pave the Path of next Generation of Innovation
Abstract:  The idea  Creating shared value  (CSV) offers a resolute direction to the debate on the link between business and society which can be restored through three distinct actions such as a) reconceiving products and markets; b) rede?ning productivity in the value chain; and c) building supportive industry clusters. The critical analysis predicts that the path of these actions is progressive in nature and their scope apparently ranges from narrow to wider deliberations. Keeping variant scope of proposed actions, this paper focuses only first course of action as it paves the path of new wave of innovation. For this new wave of innovation, the role of social capital is explored to determine the extent this capital can derive next wave of innovation. In this regard, a model is proposed to predict the link between various dimensions of social capital and innovation that can produce both social and business revenues. The proposed model assumes that narrow conceptualization of social capital to network theory only and ignoring its origins and deep rooted relations with community will lead towards routine innovations that lacking potential benefits of shared value. If organizations emphasize more and invest in developing relationships restricted to network actors, then potential benefits might be unnoticed. Therefore, like defining  value  too narrowly due to strategic myopia, keeping the social circle of small radius also limit the organization s ability to exploit the embedded potential of social capital necessary to pave the path of new generation of innovation benefiting both business and society.

Title:  Mechanism of Hyperbolic Growth Explained
Abstract:  Fundamental law of growth is used to explain the mechanism of hyperbolic growth of human population and of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Hyperbolic growth is described by a simple mathematical formula and the explanation of its mechanism turns out to be also simple. Historical economic growth was prompted by the familiar net market force, which was on average directly proportional to the existing wealthexpressed usually as the GDP. The larger was the GDP, the stronger was the driving force and the faster was the economic growth. It is shown that this simple force generates hyperbolic growth. No other force is required. Hyperbolic growth is not assumed but derived when using this force. Historical growth of population was prompted by thebiologically driven force of procreation, which was on average approximately constant per person. This force includes the natural, familiar, biologically controlled process of births, aging and dying. Here again, hyperbolic growth is not assumed but derived when using this force.Explanation of two demographic transitions in the past 12,000 years in the growth of population and of the currently experienced transition is also proposed. Currently, economic growth and the growth of population are no longer unconstrained. Other additional forces contribute significantly to the growth process and the growth is no longer hyperbolic.

Title:  The Sources of Economic Growth in Iran s Economy
Abstract:  This paper estimates the shares of Total Factor Productivity Growth (TFPG), labor accumulation, and capital stock accumulation in Iran s economy, and analyzes the time trend of the TFPG over the course of 1360-1392 of the Solar Hijri calendar (approximately equal to the 1981-2013 of the Gregorian calendar). Few studies have already been carried out for estimating sources of economic growth in various countries and different economic sectors. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to Iran s economy in recent years. After testing for the stationarity of the variables using Dickey-Fuller tests, this study estimates an aggregate production function for Iran s economy using times-series econometric methods. The results suggest that the production structure of Iran s economy is more capital-intensive than being labor-intensive. In fact, the elasticities of production with respect to capital and labor have been 0.59 and 0.41, respectively. The findings show that the average annual growth rate of TFP has roughly been 0.5% over the study time period. The other results imply that the average contributions of TFPG, labor accumulation and capital accumulation in Iran s economic growth have been 15%, 30%, and 55%, respectively. As a result, it could be inferred that the performance of Iran s economy in terms of long-run, economy-wide productivity growth has been weak compared to that of other developed and developing countries, in most of which TFPG possesses relatively greater shares in their economic growth.

Title:  The Impact of Poverty on Corruption
Abstract:  This paper examines the effect of poverty on corruption using annual unbalanced panel data analysis on 154 countries from 2000 to 2013. In the models, we use corruption measures from three alternative sources as a dependent variable while independent variables are five different poverty measures. In addition, this study has some control variables, such as foreign direct investment (FDI), trade openness, inflation rate and democracy level. According to empirical results, all poverty variables and inflation rates have statistically significant and positive effects on corruption, while FDI, trade openness and democracy levels have statistically significant and negative effects.

Title:  The Effect of Oil Prices and Regime Switches On Real Effective Exchange Rate in Pakistan: A Markov Regime Switching Approach
Abstract:  This study takes into the account relationship between oil prices and real effective exchange rate by using different exchange rate regimes in Pakistan. In this study following (Meese & Rogoff, 1988) and (Throop,1993) Interest Rate Parity has been used to construct a model by using real effective exchange rate, Dubai crude oil price and interest rate differential from period of 1970m01 to 2014m03. Through examining the results all variables are found to be integrated of order one. The long run relationship has been examined between real effective exchange rate and Dubai crude oil price in case of all exchange rate regimes with the use of regime dummies and interaction terms except for no regime, two-tier exchange rate regime and unified exchange rate regime. Similarly between real effective exchange rate and interest rate differential long run relationship has been examined in all the exchange rate regimes. Long run and dynamic result has also been detected except for interest rate differential with the use of exogenous exchange rate regime dummies. Oil price impacting exchange rate positively in both long and short run, while interest rate differential negatively effects exchange rate in long run. Through examining the results for impact of exchange rate regime switching on exchange rate, during 1970-2000 structural shifts were causing the change in exchange rate regimes with depreciation being high during this period.

Title:  Monetary Policy and Stock/Foreign Exchange Market Liquidity: The Japanese Case
Abstract:  This paper examines changes in liquidity of the stock market and foreign exchange market in response to monetary policy announcements of the Bank of Japan. In Japan, an unconventional monetary policy started from the year of 2001.This article reports on an empirical examination of the period from the beginning of the unconventional monetary policy to the present. Liquidity impairment in the foreign exchange market in Japan associated with announcements and conduct of monetary policy does not occur; however, such impairments normally do not occur. For the Japanese stock market, trade volume is associated with liquidity and the phenomenon occurs on the usual days. Market participants who obtain information about monetary policy are not subject to surprise and markets impairments do not happen as a result of the conduct of monetary policy in Japan. At least, these markets do not accept monetary policy conduct as a surprise.

Title:  The Potential Driving Forces of Wealth Accumulation by South Korea s Leading Shipbuilding Giants: Wage-Labor Nexus and Dual-channel Capital Accumulation
Abstract:  This study explores how institutional factors increase the possibility of Korea s three main shipbuilders  capital accumulation and what effect institutional factors have on their capital accumulation. By examining the structural features of these shipbuilders  labor and changes in their wage-labor nexus, the mechanisms of dual-channel capital accumulation are better understood. Ultimately, our findings show that dual-channel capital accumulation, which allows three shipbuilders to secure the practicality of overall loss minimization or overall profit maximization, has been created through the evolution of their labor structure.

Title:  Short Term versus Long Term Economic Planning in Pakistan: The Dilemma
Abstract:  For long term and sustainable economic development, countries have to start from somewhere. Thus there is a distinction between short term planning and long term gaols setting. However countries like Pakistan have mostly fell into the trap of economic plans that focus on year to year goals setting or in other words macroeconomic stabilisation and usually fail to link policies with long term plans. The paper presents data that supports the hypothesis that it is the initiative of governments and not the donors to link long term economic progress with short term policies. China is a good example in this regards.

Title:  Information Theory and Thermodynamics
Abstract:  A communication theory for a transmitter broadcasting to many receivers presented.  In this case, energetic considerations cannot neglected as in Shannon theory.  It is shown that, when energy is assigned to the information bit, information theory complies with classical thermodynamic and is part of it. To provide a thermodynamic theory of communication it is necessary to define equilibrium for informatics systems that are not in thermal equilibrium and to calculate temperature, heat, and entropy with accordance to Clausius inequality.  It shown that for a binary file, the temperature is proportional to the bit energy and that information is thermodynamic entropy.  Equilibrium exists in random files that cannot compressed. Thermodynamic bounds on the computing power of a physical device, and the maximum information that an antenna can broadcast are calculated.

Title:  Does Social Capital Have an Effect on Industry Production in G7 Countries? Causality Analysis
Abstract:  The relationship between social capital and economic growth has become an attractive research area in the literature recently. In this context, this paper examines the relationship between social capital indicators and industry production in the period of 2006-2014 with monthly data for the G7 countries. For empirical analysis, panel causality analysis method developed by Dumitrescu & Hurlin (2012) was used. Results indicate that there is a bidirectional relationship between social capital indicators and industry production. These findings support feedback hypothesis in the context of social capital and economic growth in the G7 countries.

Title:  The Impact of Technical Regulations on Trade: Evidence from South Africa
Abstract:  The purpose of this study is to investigate empirically the impact of technical barriers to trade (TBTs) by using the gravity model. The study used data from South Africa s exports of all products and other product groupings destined to 57 selected countries which comprise both developing and developed countries. To control for misspecification error the study incorporated other explanatory variables. STATA system version 13 was used to analyse the regression of data ranging from 1995 to 2015. The results revealed that TBT notifications in general are trade restrictive. The regression results unravel that TBTs negatively affect mechanic and electrical products more than other product groupings. Accordingly for all exports in general the study s findings are an increase in the number of TBTs has an effect of reducing exports by 4.88% on average. Given the results from the study it is imperative for South Africa to harmonise its standards with its trading partners.

Title:  The Association between Subsidies and Productivity: Panel Analysis
Abstract:  This study investigates the impact of subsidies, which is a proxy for incentives given to firms in an economy, on value added created by entire economy and four different sectors (i.e., agriculture, manufacturing, industry, and services).  The largest period under study is between 1972 and 2013 and the largest sample covers 151 countries. First of all univariate and multivariate fixed time effect models (FEM) and the following univariate and multivariate random time effect models (REM) were estimated using unbalanced panel data. Value added and its logarithmic values are used in the model as a dependent variable. Five different value added variables are used in order to evaluate the sensitivity and validity of our empirical results. This study empirically investigates the effect of subsidy on value added level of a country. In order to test this relationship the study use five different indicators for value added. The data used in analyses are unbalanced data and cover the years between 1972 and 2013 for 151 countries in the largest sense. The main finding of the study implies that countries with higher subsidy level experience higher level of value added.

Title:  Optimal Asset Allocation of a Pension Fund: Does The Fear of Regret Matter?
Abstract:   In this paper, which presents a simplified behavioral finance model, we incorporate regret into the decision-making process of a pension fund and derive the optimal asset allocation of a final-wealth-maximizing pension fund in the accumulation and decumulation phases. We find that the optimal allocation must be congruent in both phases if and only if the pension fund is upside regret averse. In particular, our results suggest that allocation to risky assets must increase through time in the accumulation and decumulation phases so that the pension fund can realize gains from any upsides in the risky asset market, thereby maximizing final wealth and limiting the feeling of regret ex-post. Although decisions in both phases are congruent, we find that the optimal asset allocation generally depends on wealth levels. This evidence implies that separate management of the accumulation and decumulation phases of a pension fund decreases available wealth levels and is not an optimal strategy.

Title:  Financial Equilibrium in the Presence of Technological Change
Abstract:   This article explores the issue of observable instability in financial markets interpreted as a long-term process of adaptation to demand for money, which, in turn, is based on the expected depreciation of fixed assets. Exploration is based on verifying empirically the hypothesis that the velocity of money is significantly, negatively correlated with the pace of technological change. The purpose of exploration is to assess the well-founded of policies, which use financial and monetary tools, rather than the straightforwardly fiscal ones, to stimulate technological change. Empirical research suggests that aggregate depreciation of fixed assets is a significant factor inducing slower a circulation of money.

Title:  Dynamics in Educational Outcomes by Gender: Evidence from Pakistan
Abstract:  There is strong empirical evidence that show females as a marginalized group in many aspect within Pakistan with its education sector being no different. However it is extremely important not only to document this fact but to analyze how such tendencies are evolving over time within society. This paper is an attempt in this direction, whereby in our analysis not only we assess how different are female and male population in terms of their current enrollment and attained education patterns but also in terms of structure of change in their attainment distribution as we move from older towards younger cohorts. Our findings show though gender should remain an important policy concern in domain of education sector given the prominent discrepancies in current enrolment and attained schooling estimates within male and female population, however distributional analysis of attainment patterns over age cohorts show that there is definitely some evidence of structural shifts in terms of changing economic constraints and social norms within Pakistan. This can be inferred from evidence that show much stronger inclination of higher education in younger cohorts within female attainment distribution.

Title:  Competitive Dynamics of Artificial Intelligence Economy: The Wicked Problem of Cognitive Competition
Abstract:  The competitive dynamics of the early 21st century competition are being reshaped. Much has changed in recent years as the rise of artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful force. Less understood, but overwhelmingly felt, the change is shattering the traditional vertical boundaries. With tech firms now encroaching the traditional verticals, the need for strategic realignment is apparent. Non-tech firms are responding with acquiring tech firms. Tech firms are responding with trespassing into the non-tech domains. This creates a wicked problem for traditional non-tech firms: traditional sellers of technology are now becoming fierce competitors andtraditional non-tech firms must adapt to this new reality by developing technology of their own. This paper adds to the literature in various ways. First, the paper presents a model that captures the unique properties of artificial intelligence competition. Second, the paper argues that to stay competitive non-tech firms would need to acquire multidisciplinary innovation capability as well as embrace high-performance innovation culture.

Title:  Impact of size of the National Asset Funds on Economic Development: Panel Data Analysis on Select Nations
Abstract:  National asset funds are introduced to use the current transaction surplus, except the official reserves, in the most effective way possible. It is possible to cite the sources of these funds as commodity and non-commodity sources. The initial practices have been seen in oil-rich Gulf countries as well as Asian nations which have been successful in export activities. There are different national asset funds in a number of countries in the world exhibiting different management styles. The primary goals include ensuring sustainable development, creating sources, conducting development projects and accumulating savings for future generations. In addition, they are also used to deal with possible economic crises. But these funds are being criticized because they are allegedly not transparent and they can be used as independent budget by governments. Currently, the impacts of these funds upon economic growth have been a matter of academic curiosity. The purpsose of this paper is to analyze the impact of the size of the national asset funds upon economic growth by reliance on a panel analysis of six nations employing asset funds. The findings in the analysis show that increase in the size of the national asset funds has a positive impact upon economic growth of the nations.

Title:  A Predictive Analysis of the Indian FMCG Sector using Time Series Decomposition - Based Approach
Abstract:  Stock price movements being random in its nature, prediction of stock prices using time series analysis presents a very difficult and challenging problem to the research community. However, over the last decade, due to rapid development and evolution of sophisticated algorithms for complex statistical analysis of large volume of time series data, and availability of high-performance hardware and parallel computing architecture, it has become possible to efficiently process and effectively analyze voluminous and highly diverse stock market time series data effectively, in real-time. Robust predictive models are being built for accurate forecasting of values of highly random variables such as stock price movements. This paper has presented a highly reliable and accurate forecasting framework for predicting the time series index values of the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector in India. A time series decomposition approach is followed to understand the behavior of the FMCG sector time series for the period January 2010 till December 2016. Based on the structural analysis of the time series, six methods of forecast are designed. These methods are applied to predict the time series index values for the months of 2016. Extensive results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness ofthe proposed decomposition approaches of time series and the efficiency of the six forecasting methods.

Title:  Changing the direction of the economic and demographic research 
Abstract:  A simple but useful method of reciprocal values is introduced, explained and illustrated. This method simplifies the analysis of hyperbolic distributions, which are causing serious problems in the demographic and economic research. It allows for a unique identification of hyperbolic distributions and for unravelling components of more complicated trajectories. This method is illustrated by a few examples: growth of the world population during the AD era; growth of population in Africa; economic growth in Western Europe; and the world economic growth. They show that fundamental postulates of the demographic and economic research are contradicted by data, even by precisely the same data, which are used in this research. The generally accepted postulates are based on the incorrect understanding of hyperbolic distributions, which characterise the historical growth of population and the historical economic growth. In particular, data used, but never analysed, during the formulation of the Unified Growth Theory show that this theory is based on fundamentally incorrect premises and thus is fundamentally defective. In this theory, distorted representations of data are used to support preconceived and incorrect ideas. Precisely the same data, when properly analysed, show that the theory is incorrect. Application of this simple method of analysis points to new directions in the demographic and economic research. It suggests simpler interpretations of the mechanism of growth. The concept or the evidence of the past primitive and difficult living conditions, which might be perhaps described as some kind of stagnation, is not questioned or disputed. It is only demonstrated that trajectories of the past economic growth and of the growth of population were not reflecting any form of stagnation and thus that they were not shaped by these primitive and difficult living conditions. The concept or evidence of an explosion in technology, medicine, education and in the improved living conditions is not questioned or disputed. It is only demonstrated that this possible explosion is not reflected in trajectories of the economic growth and of the growth of population. Growth trajectories were increasing monotonically during the generally claimed epoch of stagnation and during the claimed explosion.

Title:  Determinants of health and education in Latin America
Abstract:  This paper discusses the determinants of health and education in Latin America, a region which we define as consisting of the following twenty countries: Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela.  Health and education are integral factors to the productive capability and overall well-being of individuals. Therefore the factors that contribute to health and education lay the foundation for long-term economic growth that is distributed equitably throughout every socioeconomic stratum.   There are a myriad of factors that contribute to the levels of health and the quality of education experienced by individuals living in Latin America; the determinants of health will be organized such that they fall into economic, social and historical, environmental, and biological categories, while the determinants of education will be broken down into student-side, school-level, and system-wide or macro variables.   Using a panel of the twenty Latin American countries previously listed, this paper will discuss possible influences of health and education status as well as the nature of that influence; the paper will then proceed to discern between statistically significant and statistically insignificant factors.  The paper will conclude with a discussion of possible statistical flaws that could result in biased conclusions.

Title:  Determinants of value added tax revenue in Kenya 
Abstract:  Past studies that have been undertaken on the responsiveness of Value Added Tax revenues to changes in GDP in Kenya have found a positive relationship. However, the studies omit key determinants of tax revenues, such as the nature of the tax system, institutional, demographic and structural features of the economy. Due to this omission, the estimated income elasticities are unreliable for planning purposes, a situation that might be responsible for the recurring budget deficits. The specific objectives of thepaperare to establish the determinants of Value Added Tax revenue and assess yields responseto changes in bases and reforms. The paper uses Paul Samuelson's (1955) the paper are fundamental general equilibrium analysis of the public sector to derive its main results. The estimation results show that GDP elasticity is less than the elasticities with respect to monetary GDP, suggesting the existence of an underground economy. It is also found that tax yields respond with substantial lags to changes in its determinants and revenues are sensitive to reforms and unusual circumstances. The study concludes that Kenya s Value Added Tax revenue is very responsive to changes in its determinants especially international trade. There is the challenge of creating a stable Value Added Tax system.

Title:  Inflation and economic growth 
Abstract:  Attempts to establish a link between inflation and economic growth are made quite regularly. The aim of such attempts is not only to determine the impact of inflation on economic growth but also to assess efficiency of the inflation rein-in policy, for example, the policy of inflation targeting. This work reveals the nature of the inter-connection between inflation and economic growth and explains why this inter-connection cannot be sustainable without considering the third parameter, i.e. money supply.

Title:  Fiscal policy and the Ricardian equivalence: Empirical evidence from Morocco
Abstract:  This paper empirically investigates the validity of the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis in Morocco, based on recent data (1980-2016) that encompasses interesting episodes of demand-oriented expansionary government policy during the second half of the 2000s, followed by significant restrictive fiscal measures starting from 2012. We use the SVAR methodology, which enables us to make the difference between the dynamics of savings and the budget deficit by separating them into two types of shocks. Our results suggest that the equivalence is verified in the Moroccan macroeconomic framework. The paper concludes that national savings offset up to 76% of fiscal deficit shocks.

Title:  Mitigating market risks in the ASEAN ecosystem to foster inclusive growth
Abstract:  Inclusive rather than exclusive growth is the consideration of most development strategies in charting the economic growth of their country. The ASEAN as a single market and collective body should consider this as its paramount concern. Now part of inclusive growth strategies is to identify the risks and impediments to its realization. Now generally there are two types of financial risks namely: market systemic risks and the unsystemic risk. The unsystemic risk is mitigated by the Markowitz portfolio theory that was subsequently improved by Sharpe with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Portfolio theory relies on the comfort of large numbers. If you have only one investment avenue and it fails then you lose all your investment but if you spread it over 40 investment destinations then you are virtually insulated provided the investments are inversely correlated. If these are positively correlated then it follows only one direction and will simulate market systemic risk. Market risk is unexplored territory. The Mexican hat wavelet theory was used to plug the unequal equation. The U.S. government used a combination of bailout plan and stimulus package that Krugman criticized since the size of the package is a hit or miss game. If it is too much then fiscal imbalance might happen that will trigger budget deficits. If too little then no stimulus will happen. Krugman proposed exchange rate modification to make your currency cheaper for exports as an improvement of the Mundell Fleming model. Economics is interrelated and interconnected and this is very evident in financial economics. Mitigating market systemic risks relies on the interdependence on interest rates, stimulus package, and foreign exchange into an algorithm that involves the Mexican hat wavelet equation.

Title:  Factors affecting the services sector growth in Pakistan: A time varying parametric approach 
Abstract:  This empirical study followed time varying parametric approach (Kalman Filter) to find out relevant determinants of Pakistan s services sector s growth. To our best of knowledge, no author has made such study that could collect a number of variables from existing empirical literature and capture the impact of structural changes on relevant determinants of services sector growth in Pakistan while employing Kalman Filtering approach. Current study bridges this gap. Annual data was taken from World Development Indicators (2014) during period 1976-2014. Main findings of the study are that rolling regression estimates of explanatory variables justify the use of Kalman filtering approach. The state space Results show that foreign direct investment and gross national expenditures are positive and significant determinants of services sector growth while inflation, domestic credit to private sector, gross fixed capital formation, and remittances received and trade openness have negative impact on services sector growth. One step ahead graph inflation, domestic credit to private sector, foreign direct investment, gross national expenditures, gross fixed capital formation, remittances received and trade openness indicate that model estimated was stable as critical bounds(dotted line) in graph 2 are not crossed by central line. Based on empirical findings, it is recommended the concerned authorities to augment gross national expenditures and foreign direct investment to achieve long run services sector growth for better economic growth in country.

Title:  Structural capital of Malawi: Year 2005-2014
Abstract:  Not being put as a central agenda when dealing with various forms of significant capitals of a nation, structures (and processes) that carry people, actions, resources, and systems to run are very important. This paper reports the face and development of structural capital of Malawi as a rapidly developing country in Africa. The results showed that, CPIA business regulatory environment (i.e., Business competition environment), Business extent of disclosure (as it reflects Government efficiency), CPIA property rights & rule-based governance rating (Intellectual property right protection), Computers in use per capita, and Ease of doing business(i.e., Convenience of establishing new firms) remained at similar level and with less rapid growth. Positively, the number of firms using banks to finance investment (i.e., capital availability) and the Mobile phone subscribers are two factors that feature this economy s structural/process capital strength. Theoretical and policy implications follow.

Title:  Effect of welfare and economic performance on good governance outcomes in Pakistan
Abstract:  The paper undertakes a detailed analysis of economic progress and welfare measures in determining good governance outcomes in Pakistan. There is evidence that inequality stifles the capacity of political, economic and social governance by creating an elite class that protect their economic and political interests and undertake legislation primarily to the benefit of ruling elites. Furthermore our results also suggest that economic development empower the economically and socially excluded groups of the society and give them more voice in favor of policies that are representative of the issues like accountability against corruption or favoritism.

Title:  International policy entrepreneurship and production of international public goods: the case of multilateral trade regime
Abstract:  The paper considers public goods in the realm of international governance, provides a framework explaining their provision, and applies it in the analysis of the trade policymaking in the GATT/WTO. International governance regime is seen as a public good; it is conceptualized as an equilibrium state, one where the extent of ideational and material conflicts, incongruities in policy mechanisms and the lack of institutions are substantially minimised. Such state is brought by policy entrepreneurship on the part of multiple actors. Three generic entrepreneurial functions (policy leadership, innovation and facilitation/coordination) are identified. Successful equilibration is characterized by the complementarity of entrepreneurial functions, as well as by the persistence and ingenuity of entrepreneurs in selecting and using specific means and instruments of entrepreneurship. Policy entrepreneurship is considered crucial in several areas, including problem framing, advocacy and coalition building, policy experimentation, and creation of the analytical instruments. It is also salient in moderation of conflicting positions, exercise of influence and management of the policy process.

Title:  Corruption and discrimination in Douala metropolis public hospitals of Cameroon
Abstract:  The problem that arises is how the State official in a monopoly situation maximizes the value of bribes collected, by selling public services to users? To answer this question, we show that the State agent in a monopoly situation can discriminate users according to their characteristics in order to collect more possible bribes. The Shleifer and Vishny  simple monopoly model is therefore limited. The survey of patients of nine public hospitals in Douala revealed the existence of two forms of corruption at consultation: corruption without theft and corruption with theft. An evaluation of maximizing the earnings of medical doctors using odds ratios, showed that in the pursuit of these gains and whatever the form of corruption practiced, the State agent plays not only on amounts of bribes paid, but also on users  characteristics. However, for amounts between 3,000 FCFA and 5,000 FCFA, our results revealed that the doctor will tend to practice the form of corruption without theft on men, the wealthiest, the learned and the old where he/she would draw the greatest possible gain.

Title:  Globalisation, trade liberalisation and economic development in the developing countries: An overview
Abstract:  This article examines globalisation in the historical context and also its implications for development, especially in the developing countries. Economic globalisation means where all countries are developing their economies according to homogeneous rules and regulations formulated by international organisations such as the WTO, IMF and the World Bank. Globalisation refers to the opening of national markets and integration of production and increased operations of MNCs. It simply means nation-states are not able to influence exports and imports of goods and capital. And trade liberalisation is seen as a crucial policy towards globalisation. This paper will critically analyse the theoretical justification for the policy of free trade. There seems to be no doubt that globalisation has opened up a number of beneficial avenues for those countries conducive to innovation and entrepreneurship. Yet in the developing countries the fundamental problem of unemployment, income inequality and poverty persists and a more integrated economy under current globalisation has not been successful in resolving the challenges and problems facing the people in developing countries. This study concludes that the political economy of globalisation seems to be another addition to the power of global capital over national capitalist development, which reflects crisis in capitalism due to the accumulation crisis.

Title:  Gender gap is a trade trap: The road ahead for international development
Abstract:  The paper provides an outline of effective gender parity policy in South Asia with a special reference to Pakistan. The need of gender parity as an economic goal is identified by linking gender empowerment as a need to create better trade policy framework. This may provide strong public sector commitment towards bringing and implementing such laws that focus on more female participation in formal schooling as well as skill development.

Title:  The impact of participation banks on macroeconomic indicators in Turkey
Abstract:  Demand for participation banks and participation banking instruments in Turkey is increasing its importance day by day. Along with the increase in interest for theinterest-free financial instruments in international financial markets after the second half of the 20th century, demand for interest-free financial instruments in Turkey over the past two decades has increased as well. However, the share of the Participation Banks in the financial system of Turkey s economy is already only 5 %, which indicates that sufficient financial depth has not been achieved in this respect. From this point of view,in this study development of participation banking in Turkey and in the world and impacts of the funds extended by participation banks on real macroeconomic indicators (exports, gross domestic product, employment, household consumption expenditures and investments) are analyzed with the panel data analysis methodusing unbalanced panelquarterly data covering periods between 2010- 2017. The results of the analyses have shown that although its share in the financial system is below the expected level, funds extended by participation banks affect the indicators related to foreign trade, employment, supply and demand side of Turkey s economy positively.

Title:  Does Clower s Dual-Decision Hypothesis lead to the change in saving conclusion in Keynes s General Theory?
Abstract:  Keynes  General Theory (1936) is probably the most challenging economics book ever written, with an abundance of hypotheses, concepts and theories.  Twenty five years after its publication, Clower proposed an insightful explanation on Keynes, the Dual-Decision Hypothesis (DDH).  Hall (1978) and Flavin (1981) seemingly reached the conclusion that, under certain conditions, consumption was independent of income.  In contrast, Wu (2016) has shown that, change in saving has to be a function of income growth.  In fact, applying Wu s corrected consumption for period t+1, it is possible to show DDH equations leading to Keynes  change in saving (and disequilibrium) conclusion.

Title:  Turkey - Africa trade: A gravity model estimation of determinants
Abstract:  This study investigates the key determinants of trade between Africa and Turkey by using the gravity model of international trade. The major objective is to identify the core socio-cultural and macroeconomic factors of bilateral trade between both sides. Poisson   Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood Estimator is used in order to efficiently test the impact of many dummy variables and fixed effects. The results illustrate that there are geographic, socio-cultural and macroeconomic factors in the African economies and Turkey s side.  African countries near to Turkey, sharing similar religion and recorded higher economic growth rates in the last couple of decades have better bilateral trade with Turkey than the others. Besides, economic freedom improvements in these countries have positive relationship with their bilateral trade. On the other hand, improvement in corruption level of Turkey, increasing its ODA donation and opening commercial consulates in African countries are the positive factors of its bilateral trade with Africa. However, there is no statistical evidence to say Turkey s trade with Africa is for the purpose of natural resources.

Title:  Economic integration and income convergence in the EU and the ASEAN
Abstract:  In this paper, examine per capita income convergence among the countries of the EU and the ASEAN during 2000-2014 using both beta and sigma convergence and theil index of inequality in order to to explain the process of structural change contributing to the process of income convergence. Our analysis of theil index of inequality indicates that the inter-country inequality, in general, has been decreasing for GDP in the EU and the ASEAN, which is in line with the findings of  - and ?- convergence for these two groups of countries during 2000-2014. While in the case of EU, reduction in inequality in the industrial sector has positively affected the reduction in inequality in income; for ASEAN, industrial and services sector have contributed to income convergence.

Title:  The impact of macroeconomic variables on stock prices in Tanzania
Abstract:  This paper examines the relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic variables namely, inflation rate, Treasury bill rate, exchange rate and money supply in Tanzania. The paper uses monthly time series data spanning from January 2012 to December 2016 across 10 companies listed on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange. Johansen s co-integration and vector error correction models have been applied to investigate the long-run relationship between stock prices and macroeconomic variables while considering average stock price on one hand and individual companies stock prices on the other hand. We specify 11 models, whereas model 1 examines the effects of macroeconomic variables on overall stock price, models 2-11 explore the effects of the same macroeconomic variables on individual firm s stock price across 10 firms. This is important because some firms tend to behave differently as far as changes in macroeconomic variables are concerned. The empirical analysis reveals that macroeconomic variables and the stock prices are co-integrated across all models and, hence, a long-run equilibrium relationship exists between them. Equally important, all regression models pass the specification tests of heteroscedasticity, serial correlation, Ramsey RESET test of specification and Jacque-Bera Normality test. The overall model regression results show that money supply and exchange rate have a positive effect on stock prices. By contrast, Treasury bill rate tends to have a negative effect on stock prices. Inconsistent with the a priori expectation, inflation rate seems to exert no impact on overall stock prices. However, individual firms  regressions show that the coefficient on inflation is negative and statistically significant in 6 models but weakly significant in 2 models, and positive and statistically significant in 1 model. Similar controversial results across firms are revealed on the other macroeconomic variables while considering individual firms regressions. Nevertheless, money supply is found to be the main determinant of stock and hence, it should be targeted as the main monetary policy aimed at directing the stock market in Tanzania.

Title:  Evolution of the economics of science in the Twenty Century
Abstract:  A new discipline analyses the role of science in society: the economics of scientific research. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the origins, nature, evolution and structure of the economics of scientific research. The paper suggests that one of the first scholars that has tried to systematize this discipline is Paul Freedman with the book  The principles of scientific research  published in London in 1949 by Pergamon Press. In addition, the study here also endeavours to show whenever possible the evolution of this discipline through central topics from emerging research fields.

Title:  Climate change and profit efficiency in Punjab, Pakistan: Evidence from household-level panel data
Abstract:  This study seeks to examine, both theoretically and empirically, the impact of climate change on farm Profit efficiency in Rural Punjab Pakistan. Current study explores the climate change impact by using Stochastic Profit Frontier Model at farm level with panel data. The outcomes of this study are indicative of a strong impact of climate change on the agriculture of Punjab, Pakistan. Increase in long run normal precipitation and temperature have significant effect on farm profit that fluctuates in direction as well as magnitude across quarters. The incidence of weather shocks and socioeconomic characteristics of the farming households are important factors of profit efficiency at farm level. The quasi fixed inputs are positively and significantly related to farm profits while input prices contribute negatively to farm profitability. The average profit efficiency score turned out to be 0.72, suggesting that the average farm, by improving their efficiency can increase the profit up to 28 percent. The findings of present study are evocative of huge impact of climate change on the rain-fed areas of Punjab since these are water scarce areas depending on rain fall for cropping. Arguably, it is vital for the better performance of the agriculture sector to combat the impact of climate change more effectively through implementation of adaptation strategies.

Title:  A study of consumption decisions and wealth, individual data, political economy and theory
Abstract:  Recent studies have used regression decomposition to analyze recent data and found that over seventy percent of the black-white wealth differences remained unexplained (See, e.g., Gittleman & Wolff 2000; Altonji, Doraszelski & Segal 2000; and Blau & Graham 1990). Their results are limited to the variation in modern data. This study contributes improved methodology and historical empirical results to the literature on economic discrimination. In this paper, (i) presents structural regression decompositions, which are modifications to methods developed by Becker (1957) and Oaxaca (1973); (ii) presents a basic empirical test when analyzing structural regression decompositions; (iii) reports the estimated sources of black-white differences in wealth directly before and after emancipation; (iv) links these findings to recent studies. Empirical estimates confirm that the size and persistence of modern black-white wealth differences have historical roots. (v) presents decision-making considerations of  individuals  in an economy with grouped individuals, owners of firms, and social planner(s), conditional on wealth constraints with applied social economic considerations.

Title:  Evidence of random walk in Pakistan stock exchange: An emerging stock market study
Abstract:  The study reports the empirical evidence on the presence of weak-form efficiency under the random walk hypothesis on the emerging stock market of Pakistan; Pakistan stock exchange (PSX), formerly known as Karachi stock exchange (KSE) from January 01, 2009 to August 31, 2014, by investigating two categories of stock indices; one in which the selection of firms is based upon market capitalization and the other where the selection criteria of firms is based upon free-float methodology. The study applied both non-parametric and parametric tests; Kolgomorov-Simirnov (K-S), runs, serial correlation and unit root tests on daily returns of KSE-100 index; KSE- all share index; KSE-30 index and KMI-30 index. The study finds absence of random walk on the former two indices, where chronology of firms and selection criteria are based on traditional market capitalization technique. However, evidence of random walk is found in stock-indices where selection of firms is based on free floating methodology. The trace of random walk advocates the free floating methodology over market capitalization criteria.

Title: Competition between basic and applied research in the organizational behaviour of public research labs
Abstract:The purpose of this paper is to investigate the competition between basic and applied research within public research organizations. International publications are considered here a proxy of basic research, whereas self-financing deriving from technology transfer activities is an indicator of applied research. Results suggest, within one of the largest European research organizations an increasing competition between basic and applied research, both in human and natural sciences, due to shrinking of public research lab budgets. In particular, institutes and scientists pay more attention to applied research activities, which are capable of attracting market funds for economic survival of public research labs but this organizational behaviour reduces basic research activity in the long run. Managerial and organizational behaviour of public research organizations are also discussed.

Title: Interest rates volatility and its consequences on stock returns: The case study from Amman Stock Exchange, Jordan
Abstract:This paper examines the special effects of interest rates on the stock market return by using monthly time series data for the economy of Jordan over the period of 2006 to 2016. An extensive variety of econometric procedures have been involved to analyze the relationship between the interest rate and stock market return. The study exposes a constant and significant long-run relationship between the variables. By using Cointegration methods the experimental in the long run represents that a one percent rise in interest rate causes (12.3459 %)reduction in market index. The assessed error correction coefficient highlight that (-0.678522) percent deviation of stock returns are corrected in the short run. Impulse response function of the study furthermore sustains the positive relationship between the variables. The result of Variance decompositions recommends that about (99.99705%) of the variation in stock market returns is referring to its own shock which denotes that stock market returns are mostly independent of the other variables in the structure. To go over the main points, Granger causality analysis yield that there is no presence of a unidirectional causality as of interest rate to the market index.

Title: Trade openness and economic growth in East African Community economies: A panel causality test
Abstract:In spite of financial liberalization that has been discussed and studied over the past decades, the debate for the East African Community (EAC) still remain open on the relationship between trade openness and economic growth that has a link with trade-economic policies. This paper analyzes the relationship by employing the modern methodology of Dumistrescu & Hurlin (2012) Panel Causality test, The Test involved a scope of 46 years from 1970-2016. The empirical finding shows that there is a bidirectional movement (causality) as trade openness increase or relaxed lead to the growth of the economy in the East African Community. The results are supported by the endogenous growth theory that openness increases economic growth. There is a feedback relationship. The main operational implication of these empirical results is that the governments of the East African economies should dismantle barriers to trade to make sure that their intended objective is not ephemeral.

Title: Economic growth, foreign direct investment and governance oscillation: Empirical evidence from SAARC economies (1996-2015)
Abstract: Foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered one of the conventional determinants of economic growth. Economies aiming for sustainable development must focus on attracting FDI, which depends on factors such as market size, openness, resources, labor costs, productivity, growth rate, macroeconomic stability, and technology. Governance is also a key pre-determinant of FDI. This study investigates the impact of FDI inflows on economic growth via governance in SAARC economies using panel data from 1996–2015. GDP per capita growth is used as a proxy for economic growth, with FDI and governance data obtained from World Bank indicators. Results show that governance does not significantly mediate the effect of FDI inflows in SAARC economies, though institutional improvements are recommended to strengthen domestic financial markets.

Title: Expectations over durable assets: How to avoid the formation of value bubbles
Abstract:There is a finite set of characteristics which can be present in a durable asset adding value to it, and that are not necessarily part of it in the moment of its acquisition. We represent formally how the expectations over the possible future characteristics of these goods influence its price, and get the conditions for the formation of bubbles, which allows us to propose mechanisms to avoid this kind of instinctive collective regimes. Posteriorly we extend our analysis to consider the case of monopoly and of an m-firms oligopoly producing these kinds of goods, finding that the cardinality of the firm(s)' possible plans of production to maximize benefits is the same. We show relation between the assets' prices and the cardinalities of the sets of suppliers, assets' varieties and entry consumers, with an indirect dependence on the rent labor wages. We model boundedly an analysis of the effect of tendencies like corruption on newly informed and non-Bayesian probabilities that constitute the prices. Finally, some extra provided mechanisms to avoid bubbles focus in reverting badly programed rule of thumbs, to get back to the right great rules respect.

Title: Empirical analysis of relationship between investment, good governance and GDP growth rate in Pakistan (1996-2016)
Abstract:Progress and prosperity of the nations, directly or indirectly depend on economic growth of the country. High and stable GDP growth rate indicate economic strength of the nation, which depend on various economic and non-economic factors. Investment (i.e. both private and public) provides significant contribution to the economic growth and development in a country. On the other hand, non-economic factors also play an important role in developing productive environment and enhancing productive capacity of the economy. Pakistan is a developing country and its weak and unstable economy demands high and stable GDP growth rate while it is subsisting on low and unstable GDP growth rate. Therefore, it is required to explore major economic and non-economic factors that hinder the GDP growth rate in Pakistan. In order to find out empirical impact of economic and non-economic factors on GDP growth rate in Pakistan, ARDL approach was applied on time series data during the period of 1996 to 2016. Empirical results confirmed the existence of log run relationship between dependent and independent variables. In addition, the speed of adjustment was not found to be very high (i.e. -0.35362). On the basis of study results, therefore, it is suggested that there is a need of economic reforms and implementation of effective policies that can make economy of Pakistan strong and stable, which in turn enable the country’s economy to grow faster and to compete in international market.

Title: Modelling dynamics of inflation in Nigeria
Abstract:The study was motivated by the pervasively increasing inflation rate which has for the past 3 decades embattled and inhibited the potential growth of the Nigeria economy coupled with the fact that empirical studies on modeling the trend and behavior of inflation dynamics have remained largely neglected or scarcely researched. Hence, the pertinent concern of this paper is to model the dynamics of inflationary expectation in Nigeria by applying autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) cointegration framework, Error Correction model, Ordinary Least Square methods and a host of diagnostic tests on time series (secondary) data, covering 1980 to 2015. While the empirical results expedite a cointegrated and stable long-run relationship between the variable of interests when price level is the dependent variable, money supply, interest rates, fiscal deficit to GDP and international oil price shock are found to be statistically significant in explaining the dynamics of inflation in Nigeria both in the long run and short run. Consequently, the study recommends the need for implementation of strategic diversification policy to reduce the vulnerability of the economy to oil price shock both locally and internationally and also, that the government and policymakers need to swing into urgent action in initiating fiscal policy that will further enhance stabilization of the country’s exchange rate and raise the value of the Naira.

Title: The study on factors affecting the participation in the organization of the community tourism by farmer households in Tra Vinh province, Vietnam
Abstract:The study on the factors influencing farmer households’ participation in the organization of community-based tourism in Tra Vinh province was conducted by the gathering of primary data from 200 households in three islands of Tan Quy (Cau Ke district), Long Tri (Tra Vinh city), and Hoa Minh (Chau Thanh district) in Tra Vinh province. Through the use of the logistic regression model, the study found that there were six factors affecting the decision to participate in tourism, including the age of farmers, householders, and the educational level of householders, household size, family income, social relations and traditional trades. In particular, traditional trades, household income, and social relationships strongly influence farmers’ participation in organizing community-based tourism activities in Tra Vinh province.

Title: China’s monetary policy since 1948
Abstract:China’s monetary policy has evolved from obscurity into spotlight due to its torrid economic expansion in recent times, as well as its exchange rate regime that has been under constant scrutiny of its trading partners. While China’s economy is centrally-planned, it is veering more towards a market-based system with goals of stability and growth. With this in mind, this paper is an introspection of China’s monetary policy since the establishment of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) to the present. Additionally, this paper surveys empirical literature on the effectiveness of policy tools undertaken by the PBC. Recommendations are made to Chinese monetary authority on how to navigate the turbulent waves of economic fluctuations with a managed exchange rate, within its borders and beyond.

Title: Trends in the accumulation of net foreign reserves since World War II
Abstract:Taking a historical perspective, this paper observes the trend in net foreign reserves by examining data that extend as far back as 1948. It looks broadly at how reserve coverage has changed over time and the benefits and costs of holding such reserves. Moreover, it studies which countries are the biggest holders of reserves and how much they have as well as the reasons why they hold these amounts. An accompanying spreadsheet workbook contains the data for the graphs and analysis of this paper. Data come mainly from the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics database, supplemented in some cases by national sources.

Title: The future of economic growth in the World’s largest economies
Abstract:The future of economic growth is projected by solving differential equations describing growth rate date. Analysis was carried out for 12 countries representing the leading economies responsible for around70% of the global economic output. Out of all these countries, the most secure and stable economic growth is in Japan, Germany and France. In contrast, economic growth in China, India and Brazil are strongly insecure and potentially leading to the economic collapse. Economic growth in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia are on the border line. They also might become unsustainable. Economic growth in the remaining two countries, Italy and Russian Federation, is unpredictable. As for the preventive measures, for Japan, Germany and France, growth rate should be, if possible, maintained at a small value below 1%. Economic growth in these countries is described by logistic trajectories. Their asymptotic approach to a maximum value is hard to control but the growth rate should not be allowed to be substantially increased. For China, India and Brazil, growth rate should be now decreasing sufficiently fast to avoid the potential economic collapse. For the USA, UK, Canada and Australia, it would be also advisable to decrease their growth rate faster than in the recent years. For two countries, Italy and Russian Federation, it is essential to stabilise, if possible, their economic growth.

Title: Measurement of the effects of capital structure in enterprises on the probability of bankruptcy: A research on the enterprises traded in the BIST industrial index
Abstract:This study aims to measure the relationship between the Altman Z-Score, which is used to determine the financial failure of the enterprises, and the decisions on the capital structure. In other words, it has been tried to determine whether the capital structure has any effect on the risk of bankruptcy. In the scope of the research, 112 enterprises that continue their activities uninterruptedly and are traded on the industrial index between 2006 and 2014 have been examined. Panel data analysis has been utilized in order to examine the effect of capital structure on the financial failure and/or performance in the enterprises. Through the use of the Altman Z-Score (ZSCORE) which is an indicator of the risk of bankruptcy in the models formed based on the panel data analysis, a statistically negative and significant correlation has been found between the capital structure of the enterprises and the risk of bankruptcy. The leverage ratio (TBTV), which is considered as a variable that represents the capital structure, and thenon-debt tax shields (BDVK), which represent the control variable, have been used. In the correlation between the control variable and the ZSCORE, it has been found that the BDVK has not any significant effect on the ZSCORE and has not caused any increase in the total variance. The findings of this study indicate that the debt ratio in the enterprises causes an increase in financial failure, and they are also compatible with the validity of the trade-off theory.

Title: African emerging economies: The leading economies of Africa in the 21st Century
Abstract:In the last couple of decades, some African countries have achieved a significant economic improvement even though it is overshadowed by the severe poverty and conflicts in the continent. In fact, some of these countries, such as South Africa, Nigeria, and Egypt are recognized as emerging economies by many international organizations. However, there are many other economies in the continent which achieved an equivalent economic improvement recently. The objective of this study is to assess the progress of all African countries and identify the African Emerging Economies. An index with various measurements which are commonly employed by similar studies is used. Considering, the absence of the topic from the literature, this study may attract further works. The results show that at least there are 15 African economies, including the three biggest ones, which recorded a remarkable progress in the last couple of decades. These countries can be recognized as African Emerging Economies. All of these countries are also categorized as either global emerging or frontier economies by various rating agencies.

Title: An analysis on the housing price channel: The case of BRICT
Abstract:The asset prices channel, as one of the transmission channels of monetary policy, refers to the process of changing aggregate demand level by affecting the asset prices of a change in the central bank's monetary policy decisions. There are 3 basic components of the asset price channels: stock price channel, housing price channel and exchange rate channel. In this study, the operation of the housing price channel is investigated by applying Panel VAR analysis. For this purpose, the data between 2009Q1-2017Q4 period for BRICT countries are analyzed and tested. The findings show that the housing price channel is operating in these countries. The study consists of three parts. In the first part, the operation of the housing price channel is explained. In the second part, the literature research and in the third section, the empirical analysis are emphasized.

Title: An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Bank Credit on the Manufacturing Sector Output in Nigeria (1986 - 2016)
Abstract:This study examined the impact of bank credits on manufacturing sector outputs in the deregulated Nigerian economy for the sample period 1986-2016. The data collected were analysed using Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models. It was found out that banks credits contributed positively to manufacturing sector output in both short-run and long-run. For causality relationship, EXR, SAV and LR granger cause MSO. Hence, the main determinants of MSO are EXR, SAV and LR. Therefore, it was recommended amongst other things, that the Central Bank and other monetary authorities alike should make policy that will lead to increase in bank credit to the manufacturing sector. As this will play a catalytic role for growth in the sector in particular and the economy in general.

Title: Triadic explanation of public services marketing
Abstract:Although the concept of public service marketing was initially criticized in the marketing literature as confusing, it eventually became widely embraced by marketing scholars. Marketing scholars agreed that by the end of the 1970s there was no longer any serious controversy among marketing scholars about public service marketing concept. However, despite this apparent agreement among marketing academics, public administrators and academics in public administration areas have not unanimously embraced the utility of the concept of public services marketing. Two objectives formed the framework for this study: What are the assumptions, conceptualizations and disciplinary perspectives underlying the public services marketing concept? Can a superior conceptualization(s) be developed which is likely to be acceptable to a larger proportion of public services providers? Paper suggests three alternative conceptualizations of public services marketing.

Title: International trade policies: An evolutionary perspective
Abstract:ross-border trade has had a long history. It has enriched the lives of trading partners since the rise of ancient civilizations although it was the cause of some conflicts and even wars among trading partners; and between empires, colonies, and nation-states. It has increased cooperation due to harmony of interest between buyers and sellers, but occasionally has intensified rivalry, power-playing, destructive hegemonic impulses and cut- throat competition among neighbors. However, the fact that it has grown steadily through the centuries indicates that its impact on trading partners, near or distant, has been more positive than negative. One indicator of its growth, particularly in recent centuries and decades, is its size as a percentage of total world output. For example, exports, which constituted less than 5% of world GDP until the 1870s, grew to over 17% of world GDP by 1998, according to the World Bank, OECD, and WTO. This paper explores the rise of trade and changes in trade policies from the time of ancient civilizations to the present. It also examines some old and some recent trade disputes/wars. It adds to the literature by providing an overview of the foreign trade environment as well as trade patterns from different perspectives, particularly the perspectives of high versus low wage countries, the North versus the South.

Title: Fragility and macroeconomic outcomes in ECOWAS
Abstract:This study examined the nature of the interactions between fragility and macroeconomic outcomes in ECOWAS. This is despite the backdrop of evidences showing that macroeconomic policies sufficiently drive macroeconomic outcomes. Meanwhile sub-Saharan African countries have taken the backbench on almost any standard measures of macroeconomic performance within the last two decades. Contemporaneously, the region dominates the top 50 percentiles of ranking on almost all dimension and indicators of fragility.  Using a panel data for the 15 countries covering the period between 1995-2016 and employing the Panel Vector Autoregressive (PVAR) estimation techniques, the findings from this work show that the seven macroeconomic outcomes used in the study respond to fragility negatively and that fragility accounts for major sources of shocks in these economies. The study recommends that ECOWAS should employ a formidable approach to blocking this distortion called fragility.

Title: Difference in dividend policy based on the growth potential of the company
Abstract:The purpose of the study, The research objective was to determine the difference in dividend policy between companies that have high growth potential with companies that have low growth potential. Research is a quantitative study. Mean difference test is preceded by Common Factor Analysis to analyze which factors in the Investment Opportunity Set can represent the growth ratio of the company so that it can be used to separate companies with high and low growth potential. Furthermore, the analysis is carried out with a regression model to determine the difference in dividend policy on the growth potential of different companies. The results showed that dividend policy proved to be significantly different in policy between companies that grew high and low and followed the pecking order theory.

Title: To do list on the Pakistan economy for PTI
Abstract:The paper explains the unpopular decisions taken by the finance ministry when it approaches international lenders for managing national accounts by providing the case of PTI in its first 100 days in government. PTI has traditionally been vocal critique of IMF loans but had little option other than to approach the lender of last resort. The case study provides the rational for economic management that happens on day to day basis and the long term development goals that may be strengthened by keeping national accounts in balance through lending. Over the years, democracy and rule of law has strengthened in Pakistan, but the economic issues faced by majority population remain the same. The paper suggests that economic freedom is a necessary choice for a country to bring innovation to local production profile. There is a need to develop motivations through research and advocacy in the country so that a path to freer and prosperous markets are charted out that can then lift millions above poverty line through higher economic output. In short legal and democratic institutions are necessary for Pakistan’s progress but they are not a sufficient condition and may binge in absence of thriving private sector. Currently government of Pakistan is planning to implement post infrastructure CPEC projects. This paper gives a comprehensive guideline to implement CPEC projects especially that relate to Special Economic Zones through developing local industrial clusters while also developing human capital by investing in technical training of populations that reside in peripheries of these Economic Zones. This way Pakistan can become part of Chinese value chain much like Vietnam and new era of local innovation takes place.

Title: Impact of climate dynamics on cyclical properties of wine production in Douro region using time-frequency approach
Abstract:In this paper we model the impact of climate dynamics on wine production temporal cycles for the period 1933 to 2013 in the Douro wine region. We identify the cyclical properties of wine production and which cycles are determined by spring temperature and soil water levels during summer. We achieve that by applying a time-frequency approach, which is based on Kalman filter regressions in the time domain. The time-varying autoregressive model can explain 79% of the variability of wine production in Douro region. We then transfer the results in the frequency domain and can show that wine production is characterized by two cycles of 5.7 and 2.5 years around the long run trend. The in-season spring temperature as well as the temperatures of two and three years ago could explain about 65% of the variability of wine production. When the soil water level in summer is incorporated, the R2 increases to 83% and the Akaike criterion value is lower. The effects of soil water in wine production are depending on the timing. The in-season effect of an increase in soil water is negative, whilst soil water from two and three years ago have a positive effect on wine production. There is a stable but not constant link between production and the spring temperature. The temperature is responsible for two long-medium cycles of 5.8 year and 4.2 years as well as a short one of 2.4 years that began since the 80s. The soil water level can explained 60%of the 7 years cycles of wine production as well as a short one of 2.3 years cycle which has been happening since the 90s. We can recognise a shift of the relative importance away from temperature to soil water. Despite using a new an extended dataset, our results largely confirm the results of the impact of climate on the wine production in Douro region in our previous research. Modelling the impact of climate on the wine production can be an important instrument contributing for mitigation strategies facing the projected climate conditions in order to remain competitive in the market.

Title: Challenges of industrial policy to enhance competitiveness
Abstract:This study explores how the traditional approaches of perceiving competitiveness and industrial policy could be enriched through a synthetic and evolutionary perspective. Competitiveness, in particular, tends to be studied in the literature in a relatively fragmented way, focusing either on the level of individual nations, or on the sectors of economic activity, or on the firm level. As a result, the evolutionary structures that define competitiveness in a unified socioeconomic way are usually bypassed. In this context, the traditional approach to industrial policy-making, which has as sole objective the strengthening of specific sectors, is inadequate to enhance the multilevel socioeconomic competitiveness in our days. Therefore, we suggest a comprehensive re-positioning of the concept of "organic competitiveness" in overall and synthetic socioeconomic terms (firms-sectors-socioeconomic systems) as useful for a redirected modern industrial policy.

Title: Technological host-parasites co-evolution
Abstract:The fundamental problem in the field of technology studies is how technology evolves and sustains economic change in human society. This study confronts the problem here by proposing the theory of technological host-parasites coevolution, an approach that may be useful for bringing a new perspective to explain and generalize, whenever possible, the evolution of technology in human societies. Technological host-parasites coevolution is a mutual symbiotic relationship between a host technology and associated technologies directed to satisfy needs and/or to solve problems of human beings. To explore the potential of adopting a theory of technological host-parasites coevolution and to predict which technologies are likeliest to evolve rapidly, this study implements an empirical test based on historical data on the evolution of four example technologies (aircraft, tractor, locomotive and bicycle technology) to substantiate the theoretical framework. Empirical evidence is broadly consistent with the theoretical expectation that host technologies with many associated parasitic technologies advance rapidly, whereas host technologies with fewer parasitic technologies improve slowly. This study begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, the role of long-run coevolution between technologies in complex systems of technology. The proposed theoretical framework also lays a foundation for the development of more sophisticated concepts to explain technological and economic change in human society. The evolution of technology plays an important role in economic and social change of human society. However, little is known about how technologies evolve and sustain human progress, despite being a crucial process in socio-ecological systems for millennia. This study proposes, for the first time to our knowledge, a concept of technological host-parasites coevolution that may be useful for bringing a new perspective to explain the evolution of technology. Statistical results suggest that host technologies with many associated parasitic technologies have a higher rate of evolution than technologies with fewer associated parasitic systems and sub-systems. The mutual symbiotic relationship between a host and parasitic technologies seems to be an invariant property driving the evolution of technology in human society.

Title: Study on sustainability of Bulgarian agro-ecosystems
Abstract:Despite huge progress in the theory and practice of this new area, still there is no consensus on how to assess the sustainability of agro-ecosystems due to diverse understandings, approaches, methods, employed data, etc. In Bulgaria there are practically no deep studies on sustainability level of diverse agro-eco-systems. This paper tries to fill the blank and assesses the sustainability level of agro-ecosystems of different type in Bulgaria. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on overall and aspects sustainability of large (agro)ecosystems in North-Central, South-Eastern, South-Central and South-Western geographic regions, and particular main and specific types of agro-ecosystems of the country - mountainous, plain-mountainous, plain, riparian (Struma, Maritza, Yantra), southern Black Sea, mountainous area with natural constraints, non-mountainous area with natural constraints, protected areas and reserves, Western Thracian Plain, Middle Danube Plain, Dupnitsa and Sandansko-Petrich Valley, Sredna Gora Mountains and Western Rila Mountains. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in the respective ago-ecosystems. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral sustainability in agricultural ecosystems of different types. Furthermore, there are substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems of different type, and the critical indicators enhancing or deterring overall and particular sustainability of individual agro-ecosystems.

Title: Ian Kumekawa, The First Serious Optimist: A.C. Pigou and the Birth of Welfare Economics (Book Review)
Abstract:Before there was Keynes, there was Pigou.  Both students of the acclaimed Alfred Marshall, both went on to make foundational contributions to economic thought.  Keynes’s star in macroeconomics surpassed Pigou, but Pigou’s contribution to micro and welfare economics are pinnacles in their own right.  The late 19th and early 20th century Cambridge economics faculty is frequently over looked by the more recent developments in economics by the University of Chicago and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Title: Can portfolio returns exceed market return? An examination of the efficient market hypothesis for the Indian stock market
Abstract:The paper explores the possibility of forming portfolio of stocks that can generate returns higher than the market over a time period. Various principles are used for portfolio formation in the year 2013, and it is examined whether such portfolios have been able to generate excess returns over the next five years. Data has been used for Indian companies which are listed in the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange. Further, our sample consist of companies that have in operation over this period, have earned profits each year, and have consistently paid dividends in each of the years. The period under consideration has seen upswings and downswings, and it is our interest to explore whether our portfolios have been able to generate excess returns. Our results provide interesting insight into portfolio formation and also structuring of mutual funds.

Title: Inflation and economic activity in Suriname
Abstract:Maintaining a low rate of inflation and sustainable economic growth are at the core of monetary policymaking. Price stability is considered a condition for a healthy macroeconomic environment which promotes sustainable growth and a low rate of inflation is necessary to maintain stability in the financial sector as well as to boost investment activities. Motivated by the largely-discussed relationship between inflation and output, this paper examines this relationship for the economy of Suriname over the period 1975 to 2015, utilizing a vector autoregressive model and impulse response functions. The findings of the study reveal how the various sources of inflation impact on the economy of Suriname. Domestic price shocks and money-supply shocks, in particular, seem to substantially impact on economic activity. Exchange-rate shocks are detrimental to domestic prices. Based on the findings of this study, it is highly recommended for the Central Bank of Suriname to continue its prudent monetary policies in order to maintain a stable exchange rate and price stability. The study advocates for maintaining a healthy macroeconomic climate with price stability, which is a crucial condition for Suriname to follow a sustained path for economic growth and development.

Title: Macroeconomic impacts of refugee inflows in OECD countries: A panel data analysis
Abstract:The increase in refugee inflows due to war and violence in the world has revealed the necessity of dealing refugee inflows internationally. The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of refugee inflows on host economies. In this study, 36 OECD countries were analyzed with panel data method for the period 1993-2017. In the model, the number of refugees is independent; economic growth, inflation and government expenditures are dependent variables. In the first stage of the analysis, panel unit root tests were applied to test the stationary of the variables. Then, Gengenbach, Urbain and Westerlund panel cointegration tests were performed to test the cointegration relationship between the variables. To estimate the long-term relationships between variables, the Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares Mean Group (DOLSMG) estimator was used and a negative relationship was found between refugee inflows and economic growth, while a positive correlation was found between refugee inflows and inflation, also between refugee inflows and government expenditures. Finally, the Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel Granger causality test was used to estimate the causality relationship between the variables. According to the causality test results, while there was no causality relationship between refugee inflows and economic growth, a mutual causality relationship was found between refugee inflows and government expenditures. However, it has been observed that unidirectional Granger causality running from refugee inflows to inflation.

Title: Analysis of the relationship between expenditure on oil imports and public spending on selected social services in Kenya
Abstract:Since independence, oil imports in Kenya have been rising mainly to sustain the nascent transport, manufacturing, energy, agriculture and maritime sectors among other uses in the country. The growth in the country’s oil import bill has however been closely related to public spending in the health and education sectors which experienced shocks owing to the growth in expenditures apportioned to the rising volume of oil imports. Given the significance of the social pillar of the Kenya Vision 2030 and the inconsistency in the progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which is inherent in the Kenya Vision 2030, understanding the linkages between the aforementioned trends in expenditures can help in explaining the progress towards attaining the education and health facets of the social pillar. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between aggregate expenditure on oil imports and public spending on health and education. The data used was time series data sourced from Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, Central Bank of Kenya and World Bank. The study employed granger causality and correlation analysis. Based on standard Chi-square tests and F-tests, the findings of the study revealed that there exists bi-directional causality between government expenditure on health and aggregate expenditure on oil imports on one hand; and a unidirectional causality running from government spending on education to aggregate expenditure on oil imports on the other hand, both in the long-run and short-run. It is therefore recommended that the government should define what is deemed economically sustainable in regard to government expenditure on health as a proportion of the exchequer budget. It should also put in place policies that will institute reasonable margins for government expenditures on health and education to adjust as a measure to keep the rising oil import bill in check.

Title: A theoretical investigation on real sector reflection of the change in monetary policy decisions
Abstract:The aim of this study was to make evaluations on monetary policy transmission channels. A change in monetary policy is reflected on the economy not only through a single channel but also through the functioning of more than one transmission channels together. In this study, the conceptual framework of monetary policy transmission channel was examined through various aspects of the interest channel, credit channel, exchange rate channel, asset price channel and expectation channel, that are among the transmission types, and the reflections of the these transmission channels on the  real sector were evaluated.

Title: Determinants and cost of production of dates in Pakistan: An analytical study
Abstract:Present study is an attempt to analyse the production determinants and the cost of production of dates using causal approach of Ordinary Least Squares Methods using secondary data. The costs associated with the agriculture production are computed from labour costs, expenses incurring on the pesticides and fertilizers and the cost of seeds and amount of rent when the piece of land is acquired on contract basis. Provision of credit facility to the farmers and growers can play a major role in softening the constraints of the farmers and motivate them to enhance production of dates. Moreover, technical and technological advancement and adoption of the cost saving technology by farmers can also help farmers improve quality and per acre yield of their production. The findings of the study suggest that the employment in agriculture sector is the most important factor affecting production of dates followed by mechanization and technological advancement and third is the credit to the farmers. All coefficients have significance of less than 0.05 with substantially large generalizability power.

Title: Leaning against the wind: Effects of macroprudential policy on sectoral
Abstract:Use of macroprudential policies in recent years has gained relevance in different economies. As a result of the financial crisis in 2008, this instrument was useful in emerging economies to reduce the effects of the adverse international context. The relationship between financial intermediation and the real sector is positive, in response to shocks in productive credit the sectoral growth is 0.15pp in 2016. Likewise, the modification of the reserve requirement rate can provide or with draw liquidity from the financial system, in the first case, the objective is to increase portfolio placement, which affects the development of productive sectors. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the effect of changes in the reserve requirement rateon sectoral growth in Bolivia, which was offset by the financial cycle because episodes of Credit Crunch affect the real sector (the economic cycle is amplified to the downside). The methodologies used are the Fixed Effects (FE), Random Effects (RA) and Panel Autoregresive Vectors (Panel-VAR) and recursive versions of them. The positive effects of the macroprudential policy and changes in the position that this instrument had over time, depending on the financial cycle, Leaning Against the Wind. Reserve requirement ratedecreasesof the national currency has positive impact on sectoral growth and tests with recursive versions shows positive effects and increase of credit towards the sectoral activity.

Title: The effects of exchange rate volatility on foreign trade in Ghana
Abstract:This paper examined the effect of real exchange rate volatility on the growth of export and import in Ghana. A monthly data was used. All the variables were cointegrated and vector error-correction model was used. It was found that, in the long-run, depreciation of real exchange rate, increase in volatility and increase in output growth were significant factors that increased the growth of export. Also, decrease in real exchange rate volatility and increase in industrial output growth were significant factors that can reduced the growth of import. However, in the short run, depreciation of real exchange rate and reduction in real exchange rate volatility were significant factors that can increase the growth of export. Also, depreciation of real exchange rate and reduction in real exchange rate volatility were significant factors that can decrease the growth of import. Finally, considering the directional causality, the current values of growth of export is determined by the past values of real exchange rate volatility Therefore, it was recommended that government policies that stabilized real exchange rate and reduce its volatility are to be encouraged to facilitate the growth of export and discourage the growth of import in Ghana.

Title: Pareto superior dimension of rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) in Ghana: Evidence from Asunafo North Municipality of Ghana
Abstract:This study investigates characteristics of Rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) participants who join the association due to its Pareto superior allocation in Ghana. Some scholars like Dejene and Van den Brink have hypothesized that people join ROSCAs because of its Pareto superior allocation. The study employed primary data analysis in achieving its main objective.  Out of the 400 ROSCA participants sampled for the study from Asunafo North Municipality of Ghana, 71.75% joined the association because of its Pareto superior allocation. A Probit model was used to predict the probability of joining the association due to its superior allocation. The dependent variable took the value of one when respondents join the association due to its superior allocation and zero if otherwise. Married participants, participants with no or low level of education, participants who are unemployed and participants who save more of their income are more likely to join ROSCA due to its Pareto superior allocation. It was recommended that that ROSCA participants who have access (participants living in urban sectors) to formal financial institutions, participants who have accounts at formal financial institutions, participants who are rich and aged participants should be educated on how ROSCA constitutes its Pareto superior allocation.

Title: Constructing a monthly GDP indicator for Suriname
Abstract:Advancements in data collection and data processing techniques revolutionized access to higher frequency data. A large body of literature focusses on these higher frequency data in advanced economies. In contrast, small less-developed economies often lack adequate and reliable databases of high-frequency economic indicators. We construct a monthly GDP indicator, using a well-established statistical methodology. To monitor the quality of the indicator, we treat it as an in-sample forecast with respect to December observation of GDP for 2012 -2018. The results show that the constructed monthly GDP indicator is reliable and therefore its methodology applicable in many small developing countries.

Title: Interest-free window banking and finance in Ethiopia: Inception to expansion
Abstract:Interest-Free Banking and Finance services are continuously growing throughout the world in terms of customer size and the number of countries introducing the services. Entitled differently in different corners of the globe, numerous models have been implemented. Full-Fledged Banking, Subsidiary Banking, and Window Banking models are the eminent types. One of the countries, where an only Window Model has been practiced, is Ethiopia. In the last decade, the banking regulation of the country has legitimatized the operations of only Window Models. Consequently, within 6 years (2013-2019), 10 conventional banks have rapidly introduced Window-Based IFB services. Most of these windows became very weak in financing but they could attract billions of Ethiopian Birr (ETB) within a short period. As a result, the Window-Based IFB sector of the country became exceedingly characterized by cost-free deposit accumulation under the cover of a manipulated term of Interest-Free Banking. However, the parliament has approved a regulation which permits the establishment of Full-Fledged IFB in 2019. Consequently, some banks are under formation. The aim of this study is, therefore, to assess the expansion of the Window Model and the performance of the banks in deposit accumulation and financing trade and investment. A descriptive analysis is used based on mainly the reports of the banks.

Title: Inflation in Eastern China during the Second Sino-Japanese War
Abstract:Although the history of the Japanese invasion of China is well-known and well-taught in China, the history of the currency war between China and Japan during the time is far less known. From 1937-1945, China and Japan engaged in not only a military war but also a "currency war." Japan, in an attempt to generate funds for the war from the war itself and to overthrow the Chinese government, attacked China's currency, the fabi (meaning “legal tender”), by printing counterfeit fabi notes and establishing “puppet” banks in China to issue mass amounts of puppet currencies to displace the fabi. These counterfeit notes and puppet currencies quickly circulated into the economy and led to a period known as the Great Chinese Inflation. Both the Nationalists (the governing party) and the Communists immediately took different actions to control inflation and the influx of counterfeit notes. The inflation was widespread not only in Nationalist and Communist-controlled areas, but also in Japanese-occupied areas of China.

Title: International trade and economic growth in Nigeria: An auto regressive and distributed LAG bound test approach
Abstract:This paper empirically investigated the impact of international trade on economic growth in Nigeria during the period 1981 – 2017. To achieve the purpose of this research, we estimated real GDP as a function of imports, exports, gross fixed capital formation, unemployment rates and exchange rate. The methods used are: the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) techniques, Augmented Dickey- Fuller unit root test, Johansen co-integration test, error correction technique, and the Granger causality test. The empirical results revealed that: all the variables used are integrated of the same order, 1(1) except for unemployment and gross fixed capital formation which were integrated of order 1(0); also, the bound test revealed that there is evidence of the existence of a long run relationship among the variables used; while the causality test revealed that exports granger causes economic growth in Nigeria. Findings revealed that there is short run impact of export trade on economic growth. Also, causality runs from imports and exports to economic growth in Nigeria. Based on these findings, the study therefore recommends among other things that: the government should improve on her trade contents and concentrate on the exportation of labour intensive products and as a result, improve economic performance.

Title: Effect of economic growth and inflation on unemployment: An empirical analysis in Senegal from 1991 to 2018
Abstract:Nowadays, unemployment is a big issue for policymakers. The high rate of unemployment can lead to instability such as crime and poverty. For this reason, unemployment can be viewed as heartbreaking for the country’s economy. This paper mainly studies the relationship between Senegal’s unemployment rate, economic growth and the inflation rate for the period 1991-2018. In this study, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) modeling approach (Pesaran & Shin, 1999) and the bound test of cointegration were applied. Furthermore, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (ADF) and Phillips Perron (PP) was applied to the test unit root or stationary issue. Finally, the Granger Causality Test also was conducted to check if it exists a unidirectional or bidirectional causality among variables. The findings show a negative long-run and short-run relationship between unemployment, growth, industry and age dependency ratio whereas it appears a positive relationship between unemployment and inflation in both periods. It is also indicated that there is no Granger causality relationship between unemployment, economic growth, and inflation. Whereas unemployment and economic growth have a Granger causality on the industry

Title: Oil price shock and macroeconomic aggregates: Empirical evidence from Nigeria using the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) approach
Abstract:The continual fluctuation in oil price has continued to be a source of concern for economists and policymakers, both in Nigeria and abroad, given its sudden implications on existing and future policy plans as well as on some macroeconomic indicators. The Nigerian economy is an oil-dependent one and has about 90% of its export earnings come from oil and so is highly vulnerable to the sudden changes in oil prices either positive or negative. This paper evaluates the relationship between this unanticipated changes in oil price and some selected macroeconomic aggregates in Nigeria using the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) methodology while employing its impulse response functions, to further explore the impact of oil price shock on the Nigerian economy over different time period. The SVAR result shows that oil price shock has a negative impact on all of the selected macroeconomic indicators such as economic growth, import, investment, inflation, and the exchange rate except export in the long term. Furthermore, the impulse response functions shows that the response of all selected macroeconomic indicators in this study to oil price shock were mixed but mostly negative over a time period of 12 months. The ADF unit root test confirmed that all series were stationary at I(1) only except inflation rate which was I(0) and I(1). The autocorrelation LM and White heteroscedasticity test confirms the non-rejection of the null hypothesis concluding that the residuals from the SVAR model were not serially correlated and homoscedastic. Based on the findings the study recommended the diversification of the economy to other key sectors such as agriculture and mining to help reduce the over-reliance on crude oil earnings also, measures should be taken to lower the cost of production for crude oil per barrel to minimize the impact of oil price shock on macroeconomic indicators.

Title: Critical decision in crisis management: Rational strategies of decision making
Abstract:Turbulent environment can create crises that management has to soles in a limited time with critical decisions. Critical decisions are an attempt to apply efficient modes of cognition and action to enable the organization to cope with consequential environmental threats or take advantage of important opportunities in the presence of highly restricted time in turbulent markets and/or specific situations. Critical decisions involve a process of the organization’s leadership to think, consult, act, gain acceptance for optimal solutions to complex problems in the presence of highly restricted time in crisis given by scarce resources, uncertain factors, aversive environment, environmental difficulties, ambiguous circumstances, unclear and volatile situations, or a combination of these factors. This study presents the endogenous and exogenous types of crises for organizations and vital factors for critical decisions that can be categorized in responsitive, proactive and recovery critical decisions. After that, the study shows strategic operations and steps of critical decisions in a perspective of reductionism, and a rational structure based on tree diagram to systematize the process of decision making. The study here also suggests strategies for critical decisions in different environments based on theory of rational choice, such as max-min, max-max and min-max approaches, described with a vital example.  Final part of this study shows how a complex problem can be treated in different ways in a wider perspective of ecological rationality by approaches of resolution, solution and dissolution. The implications of strategic management are that the approach of dissolution of a complex problem requires design of a critical decision that may incorporate research and trial and error activities. Overall, then, this paper suggests one of the most effective way of solving systemic and complex problems by private and public organizations operating in, more and more, turbulent markets and volatile environments.

Title: Case analysis: Enron; Ethics, social responsibility, and ethical accounting as inferior goods?
Abstract:In 2001 soon after the Asian Crises of 1997-1998, the DotcomBubble, 9/11, the Enron crises triggered a fraud crisis in Wall Street that impacted the market to the core. Since then scandals such as the Lehman Brothers and WorldCom in 2007-2008 and the Great Recession have surpassed it, Enron still remains one of the most important cases of fraudulent accounting. In 2000’s even though the financial industry had become highly regulated, deregulation of the energy industry allowed companies to place bets on future prices. At the peak of the dotcom bubble Enron was named as a star innovator but when the dotcom bubble burst, Enron’s plan to build high speed internet did not flourish and investors started to realize losses. Furthermore, the financial losses of the operations were hid using the market to market accounting technique instead of book value and using special purpose entities to hide debt. The root cause that was identified as a company with a toxic corporate culture focused on officer compensation rather than social responsibility and hence faulty leadership. Is it possible then that; ethical accounting practices, social responsibility and ethics all become inferior goods as income rises in an ‘irrationally exuberant’era?

Title: The determinants of moonlighting in the context of falling wages in Cameroon: A bivariate structural Probit model analysis
Abstract:The aim of this article is to analyse the determinants of moonlighting in the context of falling worker’s wages in Cameroon. From a sample of Cameroonian workers with a main job a bivariate structural probit model analysis shows that the participation in moonlight jobs is inversely correlated with the level of education and the female gender. But it is positively correlated with both the wage of the main job and age. Moonlighting seems to play a different role in the transition from working life to retirement in Cameroon compared to developed countries.

Title: The impact of increasing VAT rate on state revenue, a South African case
Abstract:The study seeks to evaluate the impact of the increase in VAT rate from 14% to 15% on the state revenue as well as on future VAT collections. VAT historical data spanning from April 2009 to March 2018 (108 observations) on a fixed rate of 14% was obtained. Assuming no change on the 14% VAT rate,  was fitted to the data to predict the collection of R311.2bn and R326.7bn for 2018/19 and 2019/20 respectively. The difference between prediction (at 14% rate) and actual realisation of R324.8bn and R346.7bn for the same period (at 15%rate) was computed to get the impact. Based on the model fitted values, a percentage increase in VAT rate increased payments by 4.2%in 2018/19 and 5.8%in 2019/20.This results in a slight increase in the total state revenue of 1.1% and 1.5% in 2018/19 and 2019/20 respectively. Furthermore, the model forecast R313.9bn to be collected in 2020/21 at 15% rate, the lower collection is due to the covid-19 impact on revenue collection. The usage of these types of models will assist the South African government in their budgetary plans and future decisions by taking into account more accurate projected VAT collection. However, monitoring of the model is crucial as the prediction power deteriorate in the long run.

Title: David vs. Diversification: Ricardian trade theory compared to financial principles, in varied designs
Abstract:The purpose of this article is to assess the extent, if any, to which trade leads to specialization, as hypothesized by the 19th Century economist David Ricardo, or diversification, as under financial principles, and if so, when does the transition between the two occur? What other political-economic factors lead to diversifying versus specializing trade as related to risk? Were these factors present in the great rise of international trade, during the 19th Century food blights and Corn Laws? Methodologically, this article uses: historical documents, a simple game theory model, an analysis of post-World War II crises, qualitative cases of risk-reducing institutions with descriptive statistics, and a statistical regression of randomly chosen countries, explaining diversification deductively. The results show that: contrary to orthodox, “Ricardian” trade theory, trade is risky, and causes expansion into diverse firms. But, countries may then turn towards specialization, as larger economic nations may be beter able to take-on risks. Still, such states may turn immobile institutionally, while organizations and diversified supply chains have helped mollify international crises. Additionally, the discussion indicates that countries may also trade similar goods, called intra-industry trade, which reduces risk, and also intermediate goods. The conclusion addresses policies for reducing risk in trade.

Title: The contribution of economic sectors to economic growth: The case of COMESA countries
Abstract:This research examines the contribution of the Economic Sector, such as the agriculture, industry, service and FDI to Economic Growth in COMESA countries. A balanced panel data has been used over the period 2000-2019 for 12 COMESA countriessuch as Burundi, Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Rwanda, Seychelles, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The ARDL resultsshowed that in the short-run all the economic sector has a positive contribution to the GDP growth. Meanwhile, in the long-term the agriculture sector and FDI do not contribute to the economic growth of those selected countries; but the service and industry sector will have a great influence on the GDP. Therefore, the error correction model was used to analyze the long-term effect of agriculture, industry, service and FDI on GDP. The results suggest that in the short run, the agricultural sector and FDI have a positive effect on growth; in addition, the service and industrial sectors have a long-standing effect on GDP growth in countries of COMESA. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations

Title: Reflections on Zimbabwe’s past and future: Tradeoffs between the Lexus and the Baobab tree
Abstract:In early 2018, President Mnangagwa seemingly struck a new tone to the Western world that was welcoming, rather than antagonistic to business investment (Mnangagwa, 2018). Nonetheless, recent and continued land expropriations, continued deficit spending and a severe shortage of cash liquidity have made any recovery a very challenging prospect. Outside observers now have differing outlooks on Zimbabwe, ranging from uniformly “negative” to “mixed”, “neutral” or “cautiously optimistic” (World Bank, 2018; Mining Review Africa, 2018; Mdzungairi, 2018) My recent take on the country in an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal sided with the cautiously optimistic group (Richardson, 2018), but it appears I was too sanguine.

Title: The past, today and future of incoterms in international delivery: A review on the innovations in logistics
Abstract: Incoterms; are the rules regulating the distribution of responsibilities and costs between the parties at the stages of transportation and delivery of goods, regulated by the International Chamber of Commerce. Incoterms items are expressed with abbreviations consisting of English definitions' initials. They provide a common language so that every company in a global world apprehends the same way of actions in distribution and transportation. Eventually, the firms deliver their products as expected. Incoterms mentions the changes in the abbreviations as well as the transactions. International commercial terms (Incoterms) have played an essential role in implementing global trade since 1936.  As the international commercial terms are updated every ten years, the companies are more likely to be affected by the innovations made in Incoterms. In the first part of this study, Incoterms are evaluated according to how it is changed from past to present in terms of quality and quantity. In the second part, the study continues with the evaluation of delivery terms and it is questioned if the changes in the logistics have a source effect on international trade. At the end of the study, implications are given on how changes in logistics can shape the future of international commercial terms.

Title: Taxation and mobility in dualistic models – (and) Some neglected issues of fiscal federalism
Abstract:In this paper we present and confront the expected outcome of a raise in earnings taxes on the regional or sectoral allocation of labor force and employment. The basic frameworks are the benchmark dualistic scenarios. A single-input analysis of an homogeneous product economy is provided once extensions were designed to highlight the role of mobility barriers and how they interact with local wage-setting rules to determine regional allocation rather than trade issues or factor substitution. We report the main effects on equilibrium local after-tax wages, supply, employment and aggregate welfare surplus of a unilateral as well as a simultaneous unit tax increase of the (a) basic two-sector model in six different scenarios: free market; partial (one-sector) coverage with perfect intersector mobility; partial (one-sector) coverage with imperfect mobility (Harris-Todaro); multiple (two-sector) coverage with imperfect mobility (Bhagwati-Hamada); partial (one-sector) coverage with affiliation restrictions in the covered sector; partial (one-sector) coverage with limited employment generation ability in the traditional uncovered sector. Needless to say, the results would apply to any other production factor, one or other scenario being more appropriate for inference of the consequences of differential taxation systems.

Title: Opening of alcoholic drink establishments during the Coronavirus period in Cameroon: scope and economic consequences
Abstract:The objective of this article is to evaluate the impacts of alcoholic products on the Cameroonian economy following the government decision on opening alcoholic drink establishments during the period of the highest expansion of coronavirus pandemic. This objective is achieved through a dynamic CGE analysis. The main data come from a social accounting matrix for 2016 calibrated on the Cameroonian economy. As findings, a 50% increase of total alcoholic consumption in 2020 increases the demand of that sector whether the final demand or the intermediate input. The government income may increase in 2020, 2021 and 2024 but may decrease in 2021 and 2022. It may impact positively the GDP in the medium term. Finally, the well-being may be positively impacted by the year 2024.

Title: Factors for inclusion of wastewater treatment sludge in agri-food chain in Bulgaria
Abstract:The issue of utilization of sludge from wastewater treatment in agriculture is an important socio-economic and environmental problem in the European Union and Bulgaria. It is becoming topical issue along with the growing interests into effective “transformation of wastes into products” and their inclusion in supply chains and circular economy. Despite their relevance, in-depth studies of the diverse effects and critical factors of sludge utilization in Bulgarian agri-food chain are at an early stage. The purpose of this article is to identify and assess the significance of the various factors influencing the effective utilization of sludge from wastewater treatment in Bulgarian agriculture. Based on a qualitative analysis of regulations and institutional structure, and surveys with managers and experts of urban wastewater treatment plants, and farmers using and not-using sludge, the institutional, political, organizational, personal, educational, informational, social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the utilization of sludge in agriculture in two regions of the country (Sofia and Burgas) are identified. Impact factors are generally divided into two types: factors influencing the behavior of agents, and factors determining the type and extent of the effects of sludge use in agriculture. Research of this type is tocontinue and deepen to establish the economic, sectoral and regional specificities on the basis of more representative information from all participants and interested parties in the effective utilization of sludge in the country.

Title: What is structure and mechanisms of governance of agro-ecosystem services in Bulgaria
Abstract:The products and the variety of direct and indirect benefits that humans receive from nature and the various ecosystems (agricultural, forest, grass, mountain, river, marine, etc.) are commonly known as ecosystem services. Agricultural ecosystems of different types and their specific “agro-ecosystem” services are among the most widespread in the world. In recent years increasing attention is given to the system of (“good”) governance as a key to achieving public, collective, corporate, and private goals in relation to conservation and improvement of (agro)ecosystem services. Nevertheless, in Bulgaria, like in many other countries, there are few studies on the amount and importance of agro-ecosystem services, and the specific mechanisms, modes, factors, and efficiency of their management. This article tries to fill the gap and presents the results of a large-scale study on the structure and governance of diverse ecosystem services of Bulgarian farms. Firstly, it identifies the type, amount, and importance of various (provisional, economic, recreational, aesthetic, cultural, educational, supporting, water and air purification, biodiversity preservation, climate regulation, etc.) ecosystem services maintained and “produced” by the Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialization, and location. The study has found out that country’s farms provide a great number of essential ecosystem services among which provisioning food and feed, and conservation of elements of the natural environment prevail. Secondly, it identifies and assesses the efficiency and complementarities of specific modes and mechanisms of governance of ecosystem services used by the Bulgarian farms. The study had found out that a great variety of private, market, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance of farm activity related to agroecosystem services are applied. There is significant differentiation of employed managerial forms depending on the type of ecosystem services and the specialization of agricultural holdings. Furthermore, the management of agroecosystem services is associated with a considerable increase in the production and transaction costs of participating farms as well as big socio-economic and environmental effects for agricultural holdings and other parties. The factors that mostly stimulate the activity of Bulgarian agricultural producers for protection of (agro)ecosystems and their services are participation in public support programs, access to farmers' advice, professional training, available information, and innovation, received direct subsidies from EU and national government, personal conviction and satisfaction, positive experience of others, long-term and immediate benefits for the farm, and integration with suppliers, buyers, and processors. The suggested holistic and interdisciplinary framework for analyzing the system of management of agro-ecosystem services is to be further extended and improved, and more widely and periodically applied in the future. The later requires systematic in-depth multidisciplinary research in this new area, as well as the collection of original micro- and macro information on ecosystem survives, and forms, efficiency, and factors of their management. The accuracy of analyzes is to be improved by increasing representativeness through enlarging the number of surveyed farms and related agents, applying statistical methods, special "training" of participants, etc. as well as improving the official system for collecting agricultural, agro-economic, and agri-environmental information in the country.

Title: How do SMEs ensure a balanced financial structure despite bank credit rationing?
Abstract:The aim of this article is to highlight ex-ante financial imbalance so as to propose means of funding the long and medium term needs of SMEs confronting excessive bank credit rationing in order to achieve a balanced financial structure. It is based on two surveys, the first one was carried out in 2011 on 70 Cameroonian SMEs; it enabled to highlight the frequency of occurrence of alternative funding methods for SMEs’ long and medium term needs. The second one was conducted between 2013 and 2016 on 452 SMEs in Cameroon; we resorted to the above-mentioned frequencies of occurrence to spotlight the funding methods used by SMEs in a context of bank credit rationing. We then brought out the mechanisms by which SMEs achieve financial equilibrium. So our first investigation pointed to the following constantly used funding methods: equity, tontines (savings and loan associations), help from relatives, microfinance institutions, bank loans, leasing. As for the second study, there are tontines (savings and loan associations), microfinance institutions, inter-company credit, help from relatives, help from friends, contributions from associates, leasing institutions, associations, capital increase. The results thus obtained could constitute a hopeful prospect in line with the models by Modigliani and Miller, Myers and Majluf, and Quintart for those showing interest in the funding of SMEs in a context of excessive credit rationing.

Title: Impact of institution building and foreign direct investment on economic growth
Abstract:This study tests the hypothesis that institution building leads to FDI inflows and promotes economic growth rates. We also compare the estimation results when multiple institutional variables are used, and examine whether broad legal and institutional stability is important and whether specific articles are important for FDI inflows. The results of the verification revealed that (1) institution building leads to FDI inflows and promotes economic growth rates, (2) robust results are obtained regardless of multiple legal and institutional indicators, and (3) among the legal systems, the specific deregulation of capital account regulations,  laws affect FDI inflows and economic growth, and (4) the combination of an increase in broad-based legal system stability and the relaxation of capital account regulations together will promote FDI and economic growth. In other words, it is confirmed that investor and public confidence in the government and judiciary for the stability of the extensive legal system, including the protection of property rights, will bring about an inflow of foreign direct investment. (5) While FDI inflows are critical to economic growth, the study found that among institutional factors, improvements in legal and institutional capacity, in particular, are highly effective in bringing about economic growth through a rise in FDI. The importance of both capital account regulations, which are indicators that have a direct impact on foreign investors considering FDI, and legal system indicators, which show the degree of legal compliance by domestic residents, indicates that relaxing capital account regulations alone is not enough to fully promote FDI inflows. It means that the degree of legal compliance of domestic residents must be high to further promote FDI inflows. In other words, FDI inflows will bring economic growth through the maturation of the rule of law.

Title: Influencers on economic issues in Latin America, Spain and the United States II
Abstract:The technological progress in our modern societies has witnessed the emergence of persons who deploy different means of communication across social networks, seeking to generate an impact among their audiences. These efforts in social media communications attempt to alter consumption preferences and patterns, political choices, as well as reinforce or modify opinions of all sorts and stripes. Individuals who attain greater relevance due to effects they trigger on third parties are characterized as influencers, and one of their preferred means of communication are online platforms or social media. Among them, Twitter stands out as the most conducive space for debates on ideas, political parties, or public policies. This social media platform is a microblogging service that allows a person to send short messages (up to 280 characters) that are displayed on a user’s individual page, and that are replicated on their followers’ pages. In this paper, we aim to identify the most important influencers in Latin America, the United States and Spain, who use this social media network to debate issues primarily related to economics and economic policy. On this subject, there is a very strong discussion about the role that the government should play in economic life, the pros and cons of greater regulation, the problem of income distribution, the impact of inflation, and the nature of free markets and capitalism. We will first describe the methodology we employed, in order to then proceed to illustrate a ranking of the ten most relevant influencers, in terms of number of followers, from Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Spain, and the United States. We then explore their profiles and present an analysis of the economic issues debated on the relevant Twitter accounts on a per country basis. Based on this analysis, we present a hypothesis on the positioning of influencers in economic matters. Finally, the global reach of the universe of influencers that are considered in this essay is described and measured.

Title: The currency board debate of the 1940s-1960s
Abstract:The late 1940s to the 1960s featured a sustained debate about currency boards in underdeveloped (or, in today’s parlance, developing) economies and their desirability compared to the alternative of central banking. Critics of currency boards found fault with them for the foregone cost of their “idle reserves,” their implied deflationary bias, their lack of discretionary monetary policy, and their lack of a lender of last resort, among other things. Defenders of the currency board system argued that the criticisms were either incorrect or irrelevant. After carefully reviewing the debate, I opine on it, coming down mainly on the side of the defenders of currency boards.

Title: Inter-university competition in different competitive environments
Abstract:This study examines the policy effects adopted by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT), the regulatory authority, on Japanese higher education, the university. It analyze using data to analyse the effects of both regional development and the improvement of the quality of education. Three hypotheses were tested regarding the MEXT's policies on quality assurance, such as increasing the number of universities, diversification of education, regional development, accreditation systems and subsidies for private education, which the MEXT has been working on since the 2000s following the relaxation of the criteria for establishing universities. The results of analysis shows that the number of students choosing regional universities did not increase, only the number of regional universities increased. In addition, small regional universities have not been able to differentiate themselves. It was confirmed that small universities are fully competitive and that the improvement in the quality of education has not been a factor in increasing the number of students at regional universities.

Title: Economic resilience under COVID-19 in the CEMAC zone: Are procyclical adjustments of capital requirements necessary?
Abstract:This paper analyzes the effects of procyclical regulatory capital adjustments on the ability of CEMAC economies to recover from the COVID-19. To achieve the objective, it uses quarterly data from 2005 to 2020 and Generalized Least Squares estimators as a technique. The results obtained show that the severity of the COVID-19 significantly impacted the economies of the sub-region and their ability to be resilient. Further, the results are robust regardless of the economic resilience indicator considered.  Pro-cyclical capital adjustments in the pandemic context have a positive impact on resilience, thereby reducing exposure to economic vulnerabilities. It is advisable to promote countercyclical adjustments of regulatory capital to improve economic resilience. This is regardless the fact that under COVID-19, economic contractions may induce banks to adopt more pro-cyclical behavior in order to reduce the vulnerability of economies.

Title: From Keynes’ Clearing Union to the Euro-zone and the Renminbi
Abstract: The 1944 Bretton Woods agreement provided an international imprimatur for the dollar standard. H. D. White, the lead US negotiator, saw to it that the ability of other countries to obtain commitments from the US (via the International Monetary Fund) for loans or approval for currency devaluations would be limited. J.M. Keynes, representing Britain, in contrast proposed an International Clearing Union that would issue its own currency (“bancor”), intended to reduce systemic dependence on the dollar or on gold. The ICU would be a bank for the world’s central banks, which would allow debtor nations to borrow freely.  In contrast to White’s plan, ICU creditors would be expected to reduce their balances by expanding domestic credit or other means. Insights from Keynes’ plan help to understand later developments. An ICU premise was that international reserves should be pooled, and centralized.  The Bretton Woods gold-dollar standard was jeopardized during the 1960s – the Triffin dilemma -- when European creditor countries demanded gold reserves from the US. A monetary truce, proposed by Mundell, would have included 1) agreement by Europe and the US on an inflation level, and for US monetary policy to target that level; and 2) Europeans adjust their gold-to-dollar ratios to maintain the US gold stock. Monetary cooperation could thereby have created de facto international reserves. Instead, the Bretton Woods exchange rate apparatus collapsed by 1973, leaving major currencies to float. Against expectation, international demand for reserves soared. Relentless demand for US securities has contributed to deindustrialization and financial fragility, ongoing consequences of the dollar standard.  And exchange rate depreciation has done little to correct account imbalances. Clearing Union concepts help to understand the euro experiment – when it nearly failed, and how it recovered. An international currency can succeed only if 1) surplus and creditor countries are both required to adjust; and 2) member countries agree on inflation objectives. Demands on China to revalue have been misguided.  From the perspective of 2022, correction of account imbalances will not happen without the approval of the world’s now largest creditor – China – which is likely to resist any constrain on its actions.  This is and will be a drag on the world economy.

Title: Why negative rates are not a solution for Japan or the Eurozone
Abstract: Since the Global Financial Crisis in 2008-09 four major central banks have implemented Quantitative Easing (QE) programs. However, the types of QE implemented by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England on the one hand and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the European Central Bank on the other have been very different. In the case of the Fed and the Bank of England, the QE operations were consistent with an expansion of deposits in the banking system, a reduction of leverage in the non-bank private sector, and the gradual normalization of growth, interest rates and inflation. By contrast, the QE operations of the Bank of Japan and the ECB have not been consistent with an expansion of deposits in the banking system or a reduction of leverage in the non-bank private sector, and hence they have failed to promote the gradual normalization of growth, interest rates and inflation.

Title: Comparative analysis of the effects of COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021: Case study of Italy
Abstract:This study develops a comparative analysis of the effects of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) between April-June 2020 (without vaccinations) and April-June 2021 (with vaccinations) in Italy. The findings reveal that the dynamics of COVID-19 is declining because of its seasonality that reduce the effects in summer season. Hence, this study provides critical lessons that could be of benefit to countries for crisis management of pandemic diseases, showing how seasonality can reduce the diffusion of airborne disease of novel viral agents in summer.

Title: Competitiveness of agricultural farms of different juridical types, sizes, specialization, and locations in Bulgaria
Abstract:The competitiveness of farms is usually assessed through traditional indicators of technical and accountancy efficiency, the productivity of factors of production, the profitability of activity, farms’ market position and shares, etc. A systematic approach for defining competitiveness and formulating its pillars, principles, criteria, and indicators has been rarely implemented, end the critical governance aspects have been largely ignored. The article incorporates a holistic multipillars framework, and assesses the levels of and correlations between the competitiveness of Bulgarian farms of different juridical types, economic sizes, product specialization, and ecological and geographical locations. Farm competitiveness is defined as capability (governance and production potential) of an agricultural holding to maintain sustainable competitive positions on (certain) market(s), leading to high economic performance through continuous improvement and adaptation to changing market, natural and institutional environment. Accordingly, the main “pillars" of farm competitiveness are identified as Economic efficiency (Production Pillar), Financial endowment (Financial Pillar), Adaptability and Sustainability (Governance Pillar). For assessing the level of competitiveness of Bulgarian farms, a system of 4 criteria for each Pillar and 17 particular and 5 integral indicators are used. The study has found out that the level of competitiveness of agricultural holdings in the country is at a good level, but there is significant differentiation in the level and factors of competitiveness of holdings with different juridical types, sizes, product specialization, ecological and geographical location. The low adaptive potential and economic efficiency to the greatest extent contribute to lowering the competitiveness of Bulgarian agricultural producers. Especially critical for maintaining the competitive positions of farms are the low productivity, income, financial security and adaptability to changes in the natural environment, in which directions the public support of farms and their management strategies for development should be directed. A large share of farms of different types have a low level of competitiveness, and if measures are not taken in a due time to increase competitiveness by improving the management and restructuring of farms, adequate state support, etc., a large part of Bulgarian farms will cease to exist in the near future. The suggested approach for assessing the competitiveness of farms should be improved and applied more widely and periodically. The precision and representativeness of the information used should also be increased by increasing the number of farms surveyed, which requires close cooperation with other interested parties, and improving the system for collecting agro-statistical information in the country and the EU.

Title: Suggestive commitment and employability itinerary. A psychosocial study of the causes of idleness among young Cameroonians
Abstract:The complexity of the job market, which has led, among other things, to underemployment, unemployment and the tenfold increase in the informal sector, leads to the problem of the employability of young people. According to the report of the International Labor Organization (ILO, 2022), the youth unemployment rate exceeds 23% in 2021 in the Central African sub-region. To solve this problem, several strategies have been used; in particular, the creation of public and private support services for job seekers. Despite all this, the concern for the employability of young people is still acute. The objective of this research is to show that young job seekers with fatalistic beliefs who have undergone priming are psychologically more prepared than those who are not.

Title: How successful are International Monetary Fund loan programs?
Abstract:This paper evaluates the effectiveness of International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programs from 2000 to 2010 by looking at macroeconomic indicators such as the unemployment rate, inflation, real GDP, government debt as a percentage of GDP, and export value. Data is used from the year before the implementation of the IMF loan program to three years after the loan policy was implemented. We chose three years into the future because it gives time for the macroeconomic factors within a country to fully materialize while weeding out much “white noise” (shocks that have nothing to do with the program itself).  Our analysis shows that IMF loan programs between 2000 and 2010 were generally unsuccessful in improving macroeconomic growth and stability in countries that sought loans. An accompanying workbook contains the data.

Title: Beware financial conditions indicators!
Abstract:This paper compares two versions of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy: the monetarist model and the widely popular Financial Conditions Index (FCI) model. The focus is on the role of interest rates and spreads as indicators of the business cycle. In the monetarist model, following a sustained upswing or downswing in the rate of growth of money, theory and evidence point to two subsequent stages for interest rates – first the liquidity effect, followed by the Fisher effect. These two movements are in opposite directions, both being effects of prior monetary growth. The first effect is typically quite brief; the latter effect usually lasts much longer. I find that the monetarist model fits the experience since March 2020 like a glove.  By contrast, the FCI model generally ignores monetary growth and constructs an index consisting of a composite of rates, spreads and other financial market indicators. This index is taken as the driver for subsequent moves in asset prices, credit market developments and their impact on the real economy. To my knowledge, the FCI model is nowhere fully articulated and is only vaguely specified in mathematical terms. Based on evidence from business cycle developments since the onset of Covid for the US, the euro-area, and the UK, the FCI results are shown to be inconsistent and sometimes contradictory.

Title: Government failures in the COVID-19 response: A comparative analysis of China, the UK, Italy, and the US
Abstract:The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on people across the world and leaders have had to tackle unforeseen challenges. From the time the outbreak was first identified in December 2019 to the time of publication, more than 24 million cases of coronavirus had been reported globally, resulting in more than 824,000 deaths. Many countries have taken various measures to combat the virus, but the wildly different responses and response timelines around the world resulted either in failures or successes, leaving people questioning which strategy works best. In this paper, the author examines the accounts of government failure in coronavirus responses in China, the United Kingdom, Italy, and the United States that contributed to the outbreak reaching unprecedented extremes. These government failures are contrasted with Sweden’s successful laissez-faire approach which serves as a crisis response model. In sum, in the attempt to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, governments expanded and squeezed out individual freedoms and liberties which will ultimately have lasting consequences in the post-pandemic world.

Title: An overview of and a proposed reform for the organ procurement system of the United States
Abstract:Over 107,000 Americans are currently awaiting a lifesaving organ transplant. The vast shortage of organs for transplant in the United States is commonly known, but few are aware that the capacity exists for an additional 28,000 organs to be procured each year. These viable organs are not procured because of the limitations of the market and governance structure of the organizations primarily responsible for organ procurement across the United States, Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs). In this paper, the author provides an overview of the current organ procurement system and its flaws, debates the newly revised organ procurement regulations to come into effect in 2022, and offers a sweeping, market-based reform proposal for the organ procurement system.

Title: Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0: Explorations in the Transition from a Techno-economic to a Socio-technical Future (Book Review)
Abstract:This book analyzes the critical evolution from the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0), which centered on efficiency, productivity, and techno-economic goals, to the emergent Fifth Industrial Revolution (Industry 5.0). Launched around 2020, Industry 5.0 represents a fundamental shift towards a socio-technical future that integrates societal and ecological values. It is primarily characterized by three pillars: sustainability, human-centricity, and resilience. The volume, which incorporates findings from the IN4ACT research project, investigates how industrial paradigms are being reshaped to respect these broader social and ecological concerns. Contributors explore the implications of this transition, including the necessary development of enhanced soft skills in the workplace, and the profound challenges and opportunities presented by technologies like Generative AI and Artificial Semi-General Intelligence (ASGI). The book emphasizes that this shift is not just a linear technological upgrade but a complex institutional and socio-technical development driven by criticism and pressure regarding social and environmental issues, ultimately complementing and extending Industry 4.0's features to achieve a better "win-win" interaction between industry and society.

Title: International trade policies: An evolutionary perspective
Abstract:Cross-border trade has had a long history. It has enriched the lives of trading partners since the rise of ancient civilizations although it was the cause of some conflicts and even wars among trading partners; and between empires, colonies, and nation-states. It has increased cooperation due to harmony of interest between buyers and sellers, but occasionally has intensified rivalry, power-playing, destructive hegemonic impulses and cut- throat competition among neighbors. However, the fact that it has grown steadily through the centuries indicates that its impact on trading partners, near or distant, has been more positive than negative. One indicator of its growth, particularly in recent centuries and decades, is its size as a percentage of total world output. For example, exports, which constituted less than 5% of world GDP until the 1870s, grew to over 17% of world GDP by 1998, according to the World Bank, OECD, and WTO. This paper explores the rise of trade and changes in trade policies from the time of ancient civilizations to the present. It also examines some old and some recent trade disputes/wars. It adds to the literature by providing an overview of the foreign trade environment as well as trade patterns from different perspectives, particularly the perspectives of high versus low wage countries, the North versus the South.

Title: The future of economic growth in the World’s largest economies
Abstract:The future of economic growth is projected by solving differential equations describing growth rate date. Analysis was carried out for 12 countries representing the leading economies responsible for around70% of the global economic output. Out of all these countries, the most secure and stable economic growth is in Japan, Germany and France. In contrast, economic growth in China, India and Brazil are strongly insecure and potentially leading to the economic collapse. Economic growth in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia are on the border line. They also might become unsustainable. Economic growth in the remaining two countries, Italy and Russian Federation, is unpredictable. As for the preventive measures, for Japan, Germany and France, growth rate should be, if possible, maintained at a small value below 1%. Economic growth in these countries is described by logistic trajectories. Their asymptotic approach to a maximum value is hard to control but the growth rate should not be allowed to be substantially increased. For China, India and Brazil, growth rate should be now decreasing sufficiently fast to avoid the potential economic collapse. For the USA, UK, Canada and Australia, it would be also advisable to decrease their growth rate faster than in the recent years. For two countries, Italy and Russian Federation, it is essential to stabilise, if possible, their economic growth.

Title: Effect of welfare and economic performance on good governance outcomes in Pakistan
Abstract:The paper undertakes a detailed analysis of economic progress and welfare measures in determining good governance outcomes in Pakistan. There is evidence that inequality stifles the capacity of political, economic and social governance by creating an elite class that protect their economic and political interests and undertake legislation primarily to the benefit of ruling elites. Furthermore our results also suggest that economic development empower the economically and socially excluded groups of the society and give them more voice in favor of policies that are representative of the issues like accountability against corruption or favoritism.

Title: Understanding China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Hong Yu. Springer 2024 (Book Review)
Abstract:This book offers a comprehensive, decade-long analysis of the origins, evolution, and geopolitical consequences of China's signature foreign policy initiative: the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As the center of China’s aspiration to become a global power, the BRI is analyzed as both a strategic platform for driving global economic growth through massive infrastructure connectivity and an assertive instrument of Beijing’s proactive diplomacy under President Xi Jinping. The study unpacks the core motivations, including managing domestic overcapacity, securing global market access for Chinese firms, and transforming economic might into geostrategic leverage. The book’s analytical depth is provided through rigorous case studies across key priority regions, including Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Singapore, Cambodia) and the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Iran). Crucially, it assesses China's pragmatic response to international criticism, detailing the development of "BRI 2.0," which emphasizes higher standards, financial sustainability, and an expansion into digital and health sectors. Furthermore, the analysis contextualizes the BRI within the broader landscape of Sino-US strategic competition, evaluating competing initiatives like the G7’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII). This volume is an essential reference for understanding the BRI’s multifaceted role in reshaping the 21st-century world order.

Title: The Evolution and Effectiveness of China's Monetary Policy: An Introspection from the People's Bank of China (PBC) to the Present
Abstract:China’s monetary policy has evolved from obscurity into spotlight due to its torrid economic expansion in recent times, as well as its exchange rate regime that has been under constant scrutiny of its trading partners. While China’s economy is centrally-planned, it is veering more towards a market-based system with goals of stability and growth. With this in mind, this paper is an introspection of China’s monetary policy since the establishment of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) to the present. Additionally, this paper surveys empirical literature on the effectiveness of policy tools undertaken by the PBC. Recommendations are made to Chinese monetary authority on how to navigate the turbulent waves of economic fluctuations with a managed exchange rate, within its borders and beyond.

Title: Beyond Prosperity: Reconciling the Economics and Philosophy of Globalization Amidst Persistent Impoverishment in the Developing World
Abstract:The economics and philosophy of Globalization are generally not discussed together. This paper assesses the claims of economic prosperity through economic integration in the backdrop of cultural, political and social value system implications of Globalization. This debate becomes important when we see a major part of developing world still struggling with impoverishment while cheerleaders of Globalization already claim a success story out of increased integration of developed and developing economies post 1980s.

Title: Triadic explanation of public services marketing
Abstract:Although the concept of public service marketing was initially criticized in the marketing literature as confusing, it eventually became widely embraced by marketing scholars. Marketing scholars agreed that by the end of the 1970s there was no longer any serious controversy among marketing scholars about public service marketing concept. However, despite this apparent agreement among marketing academics, public administrators and academics in public administration areas have not unanimously embraced the utility of the concept of public services marketing. Two objectives formed the framework for this study: What are the assumptions, conceptualizations and disciplinary perspectives underlying the public services marketing concept? Can a superior conceptualization(s) be developed which is likely to be acceptable to a larger proportion of public services providers? Paper suggests three alternative conceptualizations of public services marketing.

Title: Corruption and Illegality in Asian Investment Arbitration. By Nobumichi Teramura, Luke Nottage, and Bruno Jetin (Eds). Springer 2024 (Book Review)
Abstract:This edited volume addresses the intersection of anti-corruption norms and international investment law, focusing specifically on how Asian jurisdictions and tribunals handle cases involving investor corruption and illegality. The book argues that, despite the increasing prominence of anti-corruption frameworks, a consistent regional approach to dealing with serious investor misconduct in Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) remains elusive, prompting this first-ever collection on the topic. Divided into three parts, the volume first provides an economic context, exploring the complex and often debated impact of corruption on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and economic growth in Asia. It then transitions to general legal issues, examining critical questions concerning the appropriate standard of proof for corruption claims, the impact of illegality on a tribunal's jurisdiction or the merits of a claim, and the emergence of host-state counter-claims. The final section offers in-depth country reports on major Asian economies—including China, India, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, and key Southeast Asian nations—to map the diversity of legal frameworks and arbitral experiences. Ultimately, the book proposes a roadmap for fostering a more harmonized and Asian-centric approach to address corruption and illegality in future investment agreements and arbitrations.

Title: A decade of unconventionality: The long-term impact of the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchases (2008-Present) on major financial markets
Abstract:This paper is a comprehensive study of the unconventional monetary policy taken by the Federal Reserve since the financial crisis of 2008, specifically on the purchases of different assets by the Fed to change medium and long-term rates.  Included in this study are the three rounds of quantitative easing, and the two rounds of Operation Twist. A study as such is needed in order to examine if the Fed’s purchases of these various long-term assets had any effect on the financial markets in the longer term perspective since the first announcement of the first round of purchase in November 2008. While there exists a variety of literature on the effects of quantitative easing on Treasuries and mortgage backed securities, there is no single study comprising of all the large scale asset purchases by the Fed, covering their effects on all major financial assets. This study is an attempt to fill this void in current literature on quantitative easing.

Title: The diverging pound: Lessons from Bulgaria's 1990s crisis and a call for a currency board in contemporary Lebanon
Abstract:Lebanon is currently facing a financial crisis marked by rising inflation rates and a black-market exchange rate that is significantly diverging day-by-day from the official exchange rate. In this paper, the author dives into Lebanon’s financial history and what actions undertaken by the government since the civil war have led to this crisis. After a thorough examination of the current economy, the author compares Lebanon’s present day financial crisis to the one faced by Bulgaria in the 1990s and concludes that the implementation of a currency board is a viable solution for restoring the strength of the Lebanese pound and ushering in financial stability.

Title: From board to bank: The Bahamas' monetary transition and a comparative analysis of economic outcomes and policy rationality
Abstract:This paper seeks to answer whether the replacement of the Bahamas currency board by a central bank was a rational decision given the subsequent economic performance climate of the central bank and the Bahamian economy. The paper describes the currency board’s establishment; its switch from the pound sterling to the U.S. dollar as the anchor currency; and its replacement by a proto-central bank soon succeeded by the Central Bank of the Bahamas, which continues in existence today. Statements of the currency board from the Bahamas Gazette as well as other sources will help analyze the aforementioned periods and illustrate the effects each transition had on the economy. The paper will examine the later years of the currency board and test whether it behaved in an orthodox or unorthodox manner as well as exploring its relation to government finance.
