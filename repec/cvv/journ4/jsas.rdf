Abstract:  The purpose of this study is to determine the factors affecting service quality at restaurants that operate in the service industry. Three restaurants operating in Trabzon were analyzed in terms of the quality of service they provided. In the study, the simple sampling random method was applied to 300 face-to-face interviews in which 30 surveys were deemed invalid and thus eliminated, resulting in a total of 270 surveys being evaluated. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was used to determine the dimensions of service quality. Subsequently, the service performance of the three restaurants were evaluated using the Topsis method (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) and the best restaurant alternative was ultimately identified. When decision matrix and evaluating the ranking results restaurant A is found 0,0019, restaurant B is 0,0017, restaurant C is 0,0018. When these results are considered in terms of service quality,  it can be observed that “A” is the most preferred restaurant by customers in terms of service performance. But the other two restaurants are so closed to “A” restaurant. This result, according to the criteria specified, may be indicative of restaurants operating in Trabzon are offering similar level of service to their customers. This study is limited to only restaurants in food-sector and only in Trabzon. Therefore, not presented any information about the validity of the results for different sectors. Future researches needs to be extended to other restaurants. Researchers also can use another multi-criteria decision making methods.

Title:  A Libertarian Analysis of “BrokenWindow” Policing
Abstract:  “Broken window” policing refers to the practice of stopping small relatively unimportant crimes (windows broken by hooligans) so that more serious ones will decrease. If the windows are allowed to be broken, criminals will get the message there is little or nothing to stop them from breaking more serious laws. The present paper looks at this practice from a libertarian point of view, and finds some of it justified, some of it not.

Title:  Anthropomorphism and Advertising Effectiveness: Moderating Roles of Product Involvement and The Type of Consumer Need
Abstract:  The goal of this study is to explore that whether using anthropomorphism in ads stimulates active information processing by increasing attention paid to the brand and creates some positive results on brand recall and attitude toward the brand. In this context, moderating roles of involvement level and product type were also investigated. Using experimental design, hypotheses were tested in two product groups. Offering important insights to practitioners to build an effective advertising message, results not only support that anthropomorphism could increase attention in advertisements but also emphasize the significance of context-specific factors in consumer perceptions.

Title:  Understanding the Role of Technology in Free and Fair Elections in Developing Countries.
Abstract:  Over the years accreditation of voters has been done using the manual method of painstakingly browsing through the voluminous voters register to verify if the voter is allowed to vote or not. Also the smart card reader has checkmated the problems of election rigging and multiple voting. On the other hand due to the aggressive voter’s education campaign by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC), party stalwarts and agents who descend on polling units on election days to woo the electorate by offering them gift items and cash if they cast their votes in favor of a political party failed. However this paper will attempt to demonstrate how the introduction of the smart card readers by INEC reduced election rigging and inflated results as compared to previous elections. The research subscribed to the use of primary data to gather first-hand information from its respondents. This paper concluded that the smart card readers introduced by INEC have indeed tackled the menace of over inflated votes and also the voters education by INEC on not to accept gift and monies from political parties at the poling units has furtherenlightened the electorate on the rules at the polling units. However, we recommend that there should be an improvement on the smart card readers so that a voter can be accredited and vote at any part of the country. Also INEC should link up with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) so as to make the National Identity Card become the voter’s card.

Title:  An Analysis of the Factors Affecting Turnover Intensions: Evidence from Private Sector Universities of Peshawar
Abstract:  High rate of turnover is one of major problems relevant to human resource management in private sector universities in Pakistan. It is on one hand, depriving the universities from talented and qualified labour force, and on the other hand, affecting the education standard of these universities. The present study was carried out to explore the inter­ relationship among the job satisfaction and turnover intentions and factors affecting them. Primary data was used for this purpose. The data was collected from a sample 150 employees of private sector universities of Peshawar. In the results, Job satisfaction and promotion opportunities appeared as significant factor affecting turnover intentions. It is recommended for the private sector universities on the basis of results of the study to give competitive salaries to the staff, increase promotion opportunities, improve leave policy, financial rewards, and make the system transparent and justified.

Title:  Public Policy Formulation in Three Selected Sectors of an Emerging Economy Case Mauritius
Abstract:  The development of public policies is common to any economy since they help define the path that a country is likely to pursue in the future. Policies aim at the betterment of mankind and when it comes to dealing with public administration, government has to critically think ahead in terms of challenges and opportunities to develop by formulating and implementing effective public policies. Mauritius, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, is no exception to it and it follows sound public policies for its long-term benefit. While policies may appear glamorous from their inception, it is important to be able to synthesise them and see how they are workable. Some policies succeed and others might fail. The researcher selected three public policies focusing on the ageing population, the services sector and international business. These are imperatives worth considering.  For each of these policies to be applicable, their mechanisms must be understood.  In this concern, the researcher developed three formulas respectively to conceptualise the public policies by highlighting how improvements or changes per component within the formula would help Mauritius attain its long-term goals. Assuming that policies depend a lot of sound governance principles and investment, the human and external factors would not be visible in the formulas which are essentially concepts that are rather understood in a simplistic manner for policy makers.

Title:  Geographical Factors in Determining IFDI Policy
Abstract:  With the initiative of the West China Development policy, the flow of Inward Foreign Direct Investment (IFDI) gradually increased in western China. This paper investigates and tests the determinants of IFDI for western China’s11 provincesduring2002 – 2008. By compiling a pool data set and employing General Least Squares (GLS) with fixed effects model in natural logarithmic form, we explorethe IFDI in western China thoroughly. The proposed model illustrates reliable estimates of determinants of IFDI for the region. The market size, laborcosts, education level, imports and highway length are found to have a significant relationship with IFDI in western China, hence, they may be considered as determinants. On the other hand, research and development (R&D), length of railways, and postal and telecommunication services have a statistically insignificant effect on IFDI.

Title:  Interfaith Conflict and Political Development in Nigeria: The Zangon Kataf Conflict
Abstract:  The goals and objectives of this research, are to investigate and analyze the different ways the Zangon Kataf interfaith conflict poses a great deal of threat to the political development of Nigeria and also to try and understand what mechanisms can be put in place to prevent a future  occurrence of such conflict. The research identified that the economic disparities in terms of wealth acquisition and trading advantage the Hausa Muslims had over the Atyap Christians for decades and also religious intolerance by both Muslims and Christians were the major problems of the research. The research adopted the qualitative method of research and also a descriptive research methodology was used. Data was collected through the use of questionnaires made up of closed ended questions. The major findings of the research demonstrates that the slow response by the security agencies to immediately restore peace, law and order in Zangon Kataf and the economic advantage by the Hausa Muslims as against the Atyap Christians were highlighted as the major findings. However this research recommends that community leaders need to promote the need for dialogue as a tool used in the settlement of disputes among conflicting parties. Also religious leaders need to emphasize on religious tolerance that is to say the need for one religion to tolerate the religious values of other religions and finally there is a need for government to formulate economic policies that will be favorable amongst the various religious and ethnic groups of the Nigerian state.

Title:  Girl-Child Education and Entrepreneurship in Nigeria
Abstract:  In Nigeria, girl-child education has been facing a number of challenges such as early marriage and economic hardship. That fewer women apply for entry to universities is a result of their being fewer girls completing secondary education and this problem has its roots in primary school. In the context of an evolving market-oriented, competitive and private-sector driven economy, corporate capitalism and globalization, education is expected to produce women that are versatile enough to acquire competitive positions as well as generate their own employment. However, the schools are often characterized by outmoded operational processes and management structures which are largely incapable of producing female entrepreneurs with the capacity to generate ideas and to turn such ideas to profitable and emotionally satisfying ventures through perseverance and hard work. Education for women and girls therefore, should aim at reversing the trend of gender discrimination by ensuring full empowerment of women in the true sense of raising their status.

Title:  The Role of Schooling in Struggling with the Middle-Income Trap: Dynamic Panel Data Analysis
Abstract:  This paper aims at examining the relationship between average years of total schooling and GDP per capita for six middle-income countries over the period 1950-2010. To this end, the paper employs panel FMOLS and panel DOLS estimators and panel Granger causality test based on vector error correction model. According to the output from estimations, GDP per capita is positively related to average years of total schooling and there is a bidirectional causality between variables. In conclusion, the paper argues that average years of schooling of people should be increased to struggle with the middle-income trap.

Title:  Ownership Structure, independent directors and firm performance
Abstract:  The paper examined the moderating role of independent directors in the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance. Using a sample of 37 finance companies listed on the main market of Bursa Malaysia from 2007 to 2011, the result indicates a significant positive moderating effect of independent directors in the relationship between director ownership and ROA but a negative relationship based on Tobin’s Q.  The result means that in a company where directors have controlling shares, having independent directors on the board will enhance performance since there will be alignment of interest of board and shareholders. On the other hand, the independent directors influence firm performance negatively in firms with majority ownership by directors since the directors who are the majority shareholders will promote their interest over the interest of the shareholders. The study has provided evidence on the moderating role of independent directors in the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance. This suggests that independent directors influence the strength and direction of the relationship between ownership structure and firm performance.

Title:  Why did I Prefer to Vote for my Political Party?
Abstract:  The case study revolves around discussions by a group of students of a popular university in a cafeteria. State elections in Uttar Pradesh had just finished and students were wondering as to how the election results were against their pre-conceived notions. They were discussing about the reasons as to why they voted for their preferred political party as first-time voters. Overall, this case study purports to assess the impact of political parties’ branding on voters’ decision-making. The case study seeks to raise three concerns: how does political parties’ branding influence voters’ decision-making? what are the key factors which influence a voter in decision-making process?, and why is psychology so different in a multi-party system in developing economies’ contexts? A consumer-oriented approach is developed for assessing the impact of political parties’ branding on voters’ decision-making. It is concluded that voters’ decision-making is influenced by the political parties’ branding initiatives.

Title:  Racial Inequality and Some Examples
Abstract:  Racism is a movement which regards superiority to the biological and genetic characteristics obtaining from the birth. It grounds on the biological superiority in the cause and effect relationships of the social and politic instances. Racism emerged as color racism in its most primitive mean then evolved into skull and blood racism types. According to superior race approach, the humiliated races were born to give service to and help the superior race. We cannot declare that neither Enlightenment and Humanism movements from the though movements developed in West nor human rights ideology was successful to eliminate the racism in the world. We observe that racism which is the effort to create unphysical qualifications from physical qualifications is utilized for colonial empires of Europe. It is well known that European countries started colonization fights for Africa, America, Asia and Oceania in order to handle the raw material need which was increased after the Industrial Period in the 19th century. The countries had used to think that colonization was the justified result which was derived from the management right of “superior race” to which they belonged. Additionally, this idea was not only adapted by state governors but also adapted by religion people, science people and thought leaders while they regarded this situation as a natural result of the process. This view of point is clearly seen on their studies. According to the result of the “Conference of Defining Racism” organized in Paris, 1967 by UNESCO; racism is a movement which was created in order to justify the invasions, slavery and colonialism.

Title:  From Project Based Lending to Policy Based Lending: An Evaluation of Structural Adjustment Lending Policy of World Bank
Abstract:  World Bank lending policies have seen considerable changes in the last half a century. Though the main objectives of establishment of World Bank after the second World War was to provide financial assistance and participate in the reconstruction of the post war devastated economies but within fifty years of its foundation, World Bank has changed its sole objective from providing project based lending to sectoral interference in the economies with policy prescriptions. This policy shift from the World Bank side has witnessed new programmes of lending called Structural Adjustment Loans. This article reviews the original objectives of the Bank and the transformation towards Structural Adjustment Lending which has changed the basic economic policies of many borrower countries and the economies of the world.

Title:  Anti-aircraft Missiles and Gun Control
Abstract:  Gun control is a highly debatable topic both in the popular and scholarly media. But what about anti-aircraft missiles? Should they be banned? On the one hand, there are fewer of them around, so their challenge is more tractable. On the other hand, they can do far more damage than handguns. The present paper is an attempt to wrestle with this challenge.

Title:  Too Much Idealism? Ferguson, Kissinger, and the Vietnam War
Abstract:  Ferguson provides evidence from Kissinger’s early academic writings involving Kantian philosophy and nineteenth century diplomacy, but continuing much later, that his subject was not the one-dimensional realist many have taken him to be. Kissinger was in fact a Kantian idealist, thought Prince Metternich to be backward-looking, and had serious reservations about the thrust of Bismarck’s power politics… Ferguson’s account of his record regarding Vietnam during the Kennedy andJohnson administrations demonstrates that Kissinger never opposed overall war strategy, although he made tactical criticisms of it.  Ferguson and Kissinger both neglect evidence that Kennedy was moving in an opposite direction regarding Vietnam, and that serious intra-Vietnam peace talks were underway in 1963. Such neglect leaves a misleading impression about alternatives… Ferguson’s account provides much evidence that Kissinger’s, and US, expectations for what might be obtained at the negotiating table in 1967-68 were unrealistic–this is a cardinal criticism of Kissinger and Nixon’s performance… Kissinger’s premises for continuing in Vietnam were usually geopolitical, rather than based on careful understanding of what was happening on the ground; and his view of power relations, at least during the 1950s and 1960s, gave insufficient attention to the role of nonaligned countries in contributing to international stability. Also, Kissingerthought maintaining US credibility an almost independent rationalefor continuing the war effort. Credibility arguments work best, however, where their advocates are otherwise on the right side of history.  Just as the US security framework survived concessions to avoid nuclear war over Berlin or Cuba, it would survive the post-Vietnam consequence thattroop commitments would henceforth be severely limited. The Kissinger-Nixon approach to Vietnam suffered from too little foreign policy realism, not too much.

Title:  Credit Allocation Based on Journal Impact Factor and Co-authorship Contribution
Abstract:  Some research institutions demand researchers to distribute the incomes they earn from publishing papers to their researchers and/or co-authors. In this study, we deal with the Impact Factor-based ranking journal as a criteria for the correct distribution of these incomes. We also include the Authorship Credit factor for distribution of the incomes among authors, using the geometric progression of Cantor’s theory and the Harmonic Credit Index. Depending on the ranking of the journal, the proposed model develops a proper publication credit allocation among all authors. Moreover, our tool can be deployed in the evaluation of an institution for a funding program, as well as calculating the amounts necessary to incentivize research among personnel.

Title:  Vine to Wine: An Analysis of Value Construction or Destruction at the Point of Production
Abstract:  Due to topographic circumstances, the Finger Lakes Region of New York is capable of producing wine; albeit the region is limited by the climate and soil types of this region. While the potential is apparent to viticulturists and oenologists, the consumers seem to be unaware or unconscious of these abilities and hold the area to standards outside of its capabilities; in regards to both volume production and varietal preference. Since the region is a consumer driven area, the relationship has been developed with wine that evolves around consumption; this emphasizes volume production that is only possible via machine practices. This use of mechanization is what fosters a disconnect between producer and product: an alienation of the vines, vintner and winemaker. This paper analyses the value construction or destruction at the point of producing and consuming wine in the Finger Lakes Region of New York.

Title:  Public Attitude to Nuclear Energy from Climate Change and Energy Security Perspectives in Turkey
Abstract:  Most of the energy-environmental policy studies have argued nuclear energy since the second half of the 20th century as it includes a number of risk factors such as high cost of plant building, radiation, diseases, power plant accidents, nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation and terrorism. The length and severity of the nuclear energy debates vary from country to country based on the several factors, in particular, the economic and social development level of the countries. Due to increasing global environmental concerns such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, natural research depletion, deforestation, ozone layer depletion and recent problems that countries experienced in terms of energy security, especially for such developing countries as Turkey, the governments have relaunched nuclear energy program again and follow their energy policy agenda in spite of occasional anti-nuclear protests in the society. In this regard, the main purpose of this study is to evaluate the public attitude in Turkey to nuclear energy in terms of environmental values like climate change and energy security and at the same time to examine reconciliation of environmental values and energy security with public attitude to nuclear energy. In the literature, many studies concerning environmental values, energy security, and attitudes towards nuclear energy have been conducted for only industrialized countries such as the USA, England, and Japan. However, developing countries with a high energy demand, technical and financial difficulties for low-carbon and renewable energy technology have been neglected, which is the source of inspiration and motivation for this study. The main finding of the study is that environmental values, especially, climate change plays a more important role in public attitude to nuclear energy in the community than energy security, which might be evaluated as an essential input for relevant stakeholders on energy policy in Turkey.

Title:  About Governance and Evaluation of Sustainability of Farming Enterprise
Abstract:  The issue of governance and evaluation of sustainability of farming enterprise like individual and family farms, agro-companies, agro-cooperatives, etc. is among the most discussed among researchers, farmers, investors, politicians, interests groups and public at large. Despite the significant development of the theory and practice in that new area still there is no common understanding on “what is (how to define) sustainability of farming enterprises?”, „what is the difference and relations between farm and agrarian sustainability?“, “which are the critical factors of sustainability of farming enterprises?”, “which are the governing mechanisms and forms for farms sustainability?”, “how to select the most-efficient forms for governing of farms sustainability?”, and “how to evaluate the sustainability level of farming enterprises” in a dynamic world, where hardly there is anything actually “sustainable. This paper tries to give answer to all these questions. First, evolution of the “concept” of sustainability of farming enterprises is initially analyzed and discussed. On that base is suggested adequate definition of farming enterprise’ sustainability as ability of a particular farm to maintain its governance, economic, social and ecological functions in a long term. After that principle mechanisms and modes of governance of sustainability of farming enterprise are specified, including institutional environment, market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes. Following applicable for the contemporary conditions of the development of Bulgarian agriculture framework for assessing the farm sustainability level is suggested. The later includes a system of appropriate principles, criteria, indicators, and reference values, which characterize the governance, economic, ecological and social aspects of farms sustainability as well as approach for their integration and interpretation. Finally, a framework for analyzing and assessing the efficiency of the individual components and the entire system of governance for farm enterprise’ sustainability is suggested. Ultimate objective of this study is to discuss and experiment efficiency of suggested framework, and after improving it to suggest it for a wider use in farm and agri-business management, and improvement of policies and modes of public intervention in agrarian sector.

Title:  IX. European Conference on Social and Behavioral Sciences, Paris
Abstract:  International Association of Social Science Research-IASSR organized ninth of its conference series as “European Conference on Social and Behavioral Sciences” themed on February 3-6, 2016, at Paris. The conference president was Çanakkale On Sekiz Mart University, Prof. Dr. Hasan Arslan. The conference was comprised from 79 sessions and nearly 400 presentations to be made in three days. Average of five presentations were planned to be delivered in each session. Twenty one of presentation was planned to be presented in English while fifty eight of them was in Turkish. Since the conference was a social science event, almost all of the studies were related to dynamism, potential and agenda of social science studies in Turkey except some health science related studies. In this point of view, Education Science was the social science discipline which had most amount of session with 19 sessions in the conference. This quantity is a normal situation for Education Faculties which focus on creating teachers in Turkey. On the other hand, Philosophy was represented in the conference with only one session and three presentations therefore this gave a clear understanding about the dynamism, focus and potential of social science studies conducted in Turkey. Firstly, the message of sufficient motivation is not provided for Philosophy science could be understood. Secondly, the result of that thought, interpretation, comprehension and contemplation level of social science studies conducted in Turkey is low could be derived. The authorized bodies in Turkey should give greater attention to this subject could be thought.

Title:  It Is Not Armed Robbery When Government Takes People's Stuff, It Is Civil Asset Forfeiture
Abstract:  Civil asset forfeiture allows the police to profit from crime instead of the criminal by seizing a person’s belongings that were used in illegal activity. The police profit from crime by keeping a percentage of the proceeds they seize. This ends up creating some perverse incentives, such as having more police resources go to seize people’s assets instead of fighting crime. Shifting police efforts away from combating hard crime into fighting so-called “victimless crimes” causes an increase in hard crimes as criminals substitute from soft crimes, such as selling drugs, into hard crimes where the chances of being caught are now lower.

Title:  Expected Challenges to implement Telemedicine service in public hospitals of Bangladesh
Abstract:  Bangladesh is a developing country where providing sufficient and affordable health-care is a challenge due to the high population density and poor healthcare infrastructure. Considering this reality, the Government of Bangladesh is going to implement telemedicine in public hospitals of Bangladesh. In order to introduce telemedicine in public hospitals in Bangladesh itis important to identify and address issues and challenges that may affect successful implementation. So, the aim of our project was to identify the challenges to implement telemedicine in public hospitals of Bangladesh. A Qualitative exploratory research approach has been used to conduct the study. The model of Khalifehsoltani & Gerami (2010) was used to investigate the six areas of expected challenges to implement telemedicine in public hospitals of Bangladesh in our study. After analysing the collected data in the light of a conceptual mode it was found that the expected challenges to implement telemedicine in public hospitals of Bangladesh are related to a lack of sufficient funds, the anxieties of patients about telemedicine, the lack of widespread and continuous education for public use of e-health services, a weakness of the software to deal with increasing workloads, shortage of technologically skilled manpower, the lack of a comprehensive legal framework about telemedicine, lack of telemedicine related policy and lack of telecommunication network in some areas of the country. Before being able to successfully implement the telemedicine project in public hospitals the government of Bangladesh needs to take some serious initiatives to solve these challenges.

Title:  A Proposed Conceptual Model for Online Car Purchase Intention
Abstract:  Several researchers addressed the problem of internet assistance regarding purchasing intention in the automobile industry, without referring to an online conceptual model. This paper presents a model which specifies online factors involved, such as: credibility of social networks, online car advertisements and information sought after about cars through online websites. The suggested online model enables the automobile industry to better study and clarify the involved factors affecting online car purchasing intention, and reveals new results. The proposed model consists of the element of trust of social networks, and how it impacts online brand image through the influence of online car advertisements and online information sought after about cars, which in turn affects online purchase intention. This proposed online model successfully explains the impact of trusting social networks on creating a positive online brand image, and on online car purchase intention.

Title:  Attitudes to Leadership and Voting: Finding the Efficient Frontier
Abstract:  Winning elections is essentially a matter of translating the attitudes of voters into votes. While there is a vast literature in political science, in particular in election studies, on the effectiveness of political campaigns in driving voter choice, we know very little, if anything, about the efficiency with which the inputs (voter attitudes) to the political process are converted into outputs (vote support). This article uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to examine the efficiency with which Australian political leaders and parties have, over the past three decades, converted voter attitudes (approval and disapproval) toward Prime Ministers and Opposition Leaders into votes (both for their own, and for their opponents’ parties). The results of the DEA analysis and associated modelling find marked differences in the political efficiency of recent Australian political leaders.   Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating had superior political efficiency in converting attitudes to political leaders into votes, while Prime Ministers Howard and Rudd were relatively less efficient in doing so.

Title:  The Effectiveness of Fiscal Rules - The Case of Switzerland
Abstract:  This paper aims to measure the effectiveness of fiscal rules. Fiscal rules are constraints on fiscal policy that limit budgetary outcomes. Some studies in the literature have examined their effectiveness using a stringency index. Arguing this index possesses some arbitrariness, this study measured the effectiveness of fiscal rules using cluster analysis. This cluster analysis resulted in dividing the data into two clusters. Using panel data of 26 Swiss cantons plus the Swiss federation over the period 1990 - 2012, a Least Squares Dummy Variable econometric model was conducted. The findings indicate that fiscal rules have a favorable effect. It was found that the frameworks of cantons in cluster 1 are more effective in decreasing cantonal deficits than those of cluster 2. Furthermore, it was found that cantons in cluster 1 have lower debt levels in comparison to cantons in cluster 2.

Title:  Resource Slack, Innovation Ambidexterity, and Quality Performance: Knowledge Heterogeneity Perspective
Abstract:  Resource slack and innovation ambidexterity can both be represented and connected conceptually with heterogeneous knowledge structure. Hypothesizing with the logic of knowledge heterogeneity, the present study empirically examined ambidexterity’s mediation effect in the relationship between two forms of resource slacks (i.e., human and financial resources) and product quality. Companies in Taiwanese manufacturing industry were located based on the random inspection conducted by the Department of Budget, Accounting and Statistics of the Government in 2011, and surveyed. Our findings demonstrated that slack resource is only an indirect factor for product quality evaluated by internal developers and producers (i.e. development and delivery processes) and external customers (product-specific quality). Specifically, first, different resource slacks influence differently on ambidexterity; second, both exploration and exploitation positively influence quality of innovation; third, ambidexterity plays a significant mediator’s role that may strategically alter the relationship between slack and quality. Research has paid increasing attention to ambidexterity (i.e., exploration and exploitation) in organizational innovation. Mostly, however, focus on the influencing factors leading to possible ambidextrous design or implementation of innovation. Few have examined ambidexterity’s effects on specific dimensions of innovation as outcomes.

Title:  12th International Conference on Teaching, Education and Learning (ICTEL) in Mauritius
Abstract:  The 12th International Conference on Teaching, Education and Learning (ICTEL) was held on the 25th and 26th November 2016 at Middlesex University. In this hectic time closing this year, eight academics who also wrote research papers made a formal presentation of their work.  Dr Banally of Global Research and Development Services (GRDS) acted as the moderator for all the presentations that took place on both days. The conference invited topics from various spheres of tertiary education while it allowed for a panoply of subjects to be treated.  There could be a high level of convergence seen from the fact that traditional teaching methodology, though still persistent, should leave the way for modern student-focused learning.  This should be coupled with high level of student interaction, the use of online technology, new methods of motivating modern learners and the need to understand generational shifts. A selective notes of conference is provided in the following paragraphs to highlight the diversity of topics treated by the various academics in this conference.

Title:  What Makes Citizens Satisfied? The Influence of Perceived Responsiveness of Local Administration on Satisfaction with Public Administration
Abstract:  There is no other institution that people regularly have so much direct contact with as public administration, although people have different experiences with public administration. Some citizens feel comfortable when making contact with bureaucracy; some have rather negative feelings. Besides the factors ‘trust’ and ‘satisfaction’ with public administration, there might be one other relevant factor: ‘responsiveness’. Based on representative population surveys, this paper can show that the perception of administration as responsive is directly related to the user’s satisfaction with it, and that the main factor explaining perceived satisfaction with public administration is the reputation of the local public administration.

Title:  The Impact of the Employment Protection Legislation Reform on the Labor Market’s Flexicurity in Morocco
Abstract:  This paper uses the OECD’s methodology to build an Employment Protection Legislation index (EPL) for the Moroccan economy. In this framework, the main objective is to assess the impact of the new Labor Code’s provisions on the degree of flexicurity in the labor market. The paper also investigates the approximate influence of the EPL changes as regards to some employment-related variables. Our results show that after the 2004 Labor Code reform, the labor market’s flexibility level went down from 75 percent to 44 percent, as EPL became significantly stricter. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the new legislation, although it brought relatively strict restrictions on hiring and firing, generated a significant increase in dismissals during the three first years of its implementation. And unlike the buckle of conventional literature and several empirical findings, the unemployment rate actually dropped, allegedly backed-up by a solid GDP growth during the 2000’s.

Title:  Political Instability and Lessons for Pakistan: Case Study of 2014 PTI Sit in/Protests
Abstract:  It’s a short allegory to present the case for the importance of Political stability in the economic progress of a country. The Arab spring protests were seen as strengthening democracy in the Arab world. Notwithstanding the surprise Arab spring brought in shape of further destabilizing Middle East, a similar environment of unrest and protests in a practicing democracy like Pakistan capture same dynamics of uncertainty that dampen economic destabilization. The paper briefly covers PTI’s sit in protests in year 2014 to make a case for how political instability stifled economic progress in Pakistan though momentarily.

Title:  Change Pressure on Organizational Commitment and Identification: Knowledge and Decision-making Competencies in Government Units
Abstract:  Staffs in government units may encounter problems of pressure when facing dramatic organizational changes. In an interesting context of administrative merge of Kaohsiung city and county, we examined the influences of change pressure on post-merger organizational identification and commitment. We further developed and investigated the detailed relationships from competence perspective, which emphasizes the importance of knowledge processing and decision making capabilities. Results followed. First, the hypothesized negative impact of change pressure on organizational identification was not supported. Second, change pressure has a significant negative influence on commitment. Third, identification influences on commitment positively. Fourth, the positive moderation role of knowledge capability in the relationship between pressure and identification was not supported. Fifth, the positive moderation role of knowledge capability in the relationship between change pressure and commitment was supported.

Title:  Informatics Carnot Machine in an Optical Fiber
Abstract:  Based on Planck's blackbody equation it argued that a single mode light pulse, with a large number of photons, carries one entropy unit. Similarly, an empty radiation mode carries no entropy. In this case, the calculated entropy that a coded sequence of light pulses is carrying is simply the Gibbs mixing entropy, which is identical to the logical Shannon information. This approach supported by a demonstration that information transmission and amplification, by a sequence of light pulses in an optical fiber, is a classic Carnot machine comprising of two isothermals and two adiabatic. Therefore, it concluded that entropy under certain conditions is information.

Title:  Assessing Multi-aspects and Integral Sustainability of Bulgarian Farms
Abstract:  The issue of assessment sustainability of agricultural farms as a whole and of different type is among the most topical for researchers, farmers, investors, administrators, politicians, interests groups and public at large. Despite that practically there are no assessments on sustainability level of Bulgarian farms in conditions of European Union Common Agricultural Policy implementation. This article applies a holistic framework and assesses sustainability of Bulgarian farms as a whole and of different juridical type, size, production specialization, and ecological and geographical location. Initially the method of the study is outlined, and overall characteristics of surveyed holdings presented. After that an assessment is made of integral, governance, economic, social, environmental sustainability of farms in general and of different type and location. Next, structure of farms with different sustainability levels is analyzed. Finally, factors for improving sustainability of Bulgarian farms are identified, and directions for further research and amelioration of farm management and public intervention in the sector suggested.Our study has found out that overall sustainability of Bulgarian farms is at a good level, with superior levels for environmental and social sustainability, and inferior level for governance and economic sustainability. There are great variations in sustainability levels of farms of different type and location as well as in shares of holdings with unlike level of sustainability. Factors which stimulate to the greatest extent the actions of Bulgarian farms for improving individual aspects of sustainability are Access to Advisory Services, Professional Training of Manager and Hired Labor, Personal Conviction and Satisfaction, Positive Experience of Other Farms, Available Innovations, Financial Capability, Private Contracts and Agreements, and Registration and Certification of Products, Services, etc. National and European mechanisms of regulation and support, which affect to the greatest extent economic sustainability of Bulgarian farms are: Direct Area Based Payments, National Tops Ups for Products, Livestock, etc., Modernization of Agricultural Holdings, Green Payments, Support to Semi-market Farms.

Title:  Sukuk: Literature Review
Abstract:  At the heart of a global financial crisis triggered since 2008, Islamic finance has been seen as an alternative less affected by the global crisis to cover the financing and investment needs and bringing a new vision that involves sharing of losses and gains and thus prohibit the notion of the interest rate. With the emergence of the concept of Islamic finance a new market has emerged known as sukuk market where its last ones play the role of bonds. These financial instruments have been able, like conventional bonds, to constitute a reliable investment alternative for both companies and governments that want to conduct their business within a framework that respects the precepts of the Sharia. The purpose of this article is to understand the concept and the mechanism of these obligations and to present a review of the literature on sukuks.

Title:  Application of Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making Methods on Six Sigma Projects Selection
Abstract:  Six sigma method widely applied in production and service businesses is known as a project-oriented method. In six sigma method, selection of the prior project among others can be considered as a multi -criteria decision making problem. The conducted literature review has revealed that there is a large number of methods to select six sigma projects. It is more appropriate to use fuzzy multi-criteria decision making methods in project selection since evaluation criteria of six sigma projects include uncertainties. The aim of this study is to select the most appropriate project as a result of evaluating the projects by Fuzzy VIKOR, Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy COPRAS as methods of fuzzy multicriteria decision-making and integrating the ranking scores obtained from each method by Copeland method. The proposed method has been implemented in a large scale production company, operating in Aydýn ASTÝM Organized Industrial Zone.

Title:  Multinational Corporations and Nation-States: Managing Shared- and Conflicts of Interest
Abstract:  Satisfactory and mutually beneficial relationships between multinational corporations and individual nation-states are sustainable as long as their perceived shared interests exceed any conflicts of interest. However, when events, or actions intentionally taken by either side or dictated by circumstances, alter an acceptable balance between the shared- and conflicts of interest, a good business relationship can deteriorate fast to the detriment of one or both sides. Thus, shared-interests cannot be assumed to continue over the long-range without consistent efforts by both sides to maintain them and, in the meantime, keep conflicts of interest within a tolerable level. This paper explores the factors that contribute to sustaining shared interests and containing conflicts of interest between multinational corporations and nation-states in order to avoid a deteriorations or possible disruption of an otherwise mutually beneficial relationship. Of the questions to be addressed are: what strategies and actions can help in strengthening the shared interests, and what actions and policy changes contribute to an increase in the conflicts of interest between nation-states and multinational corporations?

Title:  Exploring the Influential Factors of Cluster Cooperation in Taiwan’s Biotechnology Industry
Abstract:  In recent years, numerous countries around the world have continually devoted substantial efforts to the biotechnology industry. Despite its endeavors over two decades, Taiwan’s biotechnology industry has not yet made any remarkable achievements. In this study, influential factors of cooperation in the biotechnology industry are discussed from the perspectives of cluster cooperation and interaction. Using the analytic hierarchy process and quantitative results obtained from in-depth expert interview questionnaires, the weights of various influential factors are investigated and analyzed, which could provide a reference for future research and resource allocations. The influential factors of cluster cooperation in Taiwan’s biotechnology industry can be categorized into four major factors and sixteen sub-factors. The results indicate that among all of the factors that impact cluster cooperation in the biotechnology industry, “enterprise innovation ability” is the most critical. The innovation capacity of cooperative partners is always considered a priority in cluster cooperation among enterprises, whereas research and development (R&D), personnel quality, and the R&D environment are the most crucial sub-factors within the primary dimension of enterprise innovation ability. This finding is consistent with the fact that a biotechnology product is closely bound to innovative R&D, from its initial development stage to the eventual clinical launch. Factors of secondary importance include business management ability and government resource utilization, which suggests that the principal activities associated with cluster cooperation in the biotechnology industry depend heavily on an enterprise’s business management ability and are inextricably linked to government resource utilization.

Title:  Teachers’ Classroom management and Quality Assurance of Students’ Learning Outcome in Secondary Schools in Ondo State, Nigeria
Abstract:  The study assessed teachers’ classroom management strategies, the level of teachers' classroom instructional tasks and determined the effect on students’ academic performance, and further examined the constraints in classroom management in secondary schools in Akure South Local Government Area of Ondo State, Nigeria. Descriptive survey and ex post facto research designs were adopted. Five research questions and two hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. The sample consisted of 854 respondents, made up of 560 students, 280 teachers and 14 principals selected from 14 secondary schools using simple random sampling technique. Data were collected using “Teachers’ Classroom Management Strategies Questionnaire” (TCMSQ), and “Students’ Academic Performance Proforma” (SAPP). Data were analyzed, using percentage, mean score and Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient at alpha level of 0.05. Findings showed significant relationship between teachers’ classroom management and students’ academic performance (r-cal = 0.307, p<0.05), and significant relationship between teachers' instructional tasks and students' academic performance (r-cal=0.689, p<0.05), while teachers were effective in classroom management strategies as reflected in preparation of lesson notes (71.4%), communication skill (63.6%), students’ motivation (62.5%), group interaction (71.4%) and exemplary behaviour (64.3%). The major constraints faced by teachers were excessive workload (56.4%), ill-equipped laboratory (57.9%), ill-equipped library (63.6%), shortage of instructional materials (64.3%), lack of students’ learning materials (64%) and congested class size (75%). Based on the findings, it was recommended that the Government should employ adequate number of qualified teachers to reduce instructional workload to manageable level. Also, Government in collaboration with the Parents - Teachers Association and other Development Partners should provide adequate learning facilities and materials that would improve classroom management and students’ learning outcome in secondary schools.

Title:  Nature and Scope of Open Government Data (OGD) in Oman
Abstract:  With the transition of governments to e-governments, the latest measure of ensuring transparency and accountability is through providing more and more access to government data which was hitherto reserved in “silos”. This is the process entailed in "Open Governments" and the data thus opened freely is called "Open Government Data" (OGD). The transition of traditional governments to e-governments has been amply covered in extant literature. However, Open Government is regarded as the final culmination of e-government in a bid to restore public accountability and promote transparency in government besides forging government-citizen ties. In this paper, the nature and scope of OGD of Oman is being investigated. Also, the facilitating and hindering factors in tapping OGD are being discussed in the paper. The paper concludes with directions for further research and academic-cum-practitioner implications. The originality of the paper lies in the fact that the nature and scope of OGD has not been investigated in detail as far as Oman is concerned-the present study seeks to plug this gap.

Title:  From 1980 on, the Impact of the Globalization on Democracy and nation State Concept Turkey Evaluation
Abstract:  This study aims to present a thorough understanding of the process of globalization and analyze the current effects and changes of globalization on nation state. In accordance with this viewpoint, the concept and the development of globalization, its dimensions, various aspects and actors are addressed, and the relations between globalization and nation state are demonstrated. The second part of the study explains how nation state is affected by the process of globalization, and how the functions of nation state shrink in political and economic sense. This part also reveals the roles of international capital and institutions (as the primary actors of the process of globalization) on the changing functions of nation state. In this part, light is shed on how nation state delegates authority to supra-national and sub-national units, and how independent monetary, fiscal, foreign trade and employment policies face challenges in application due to the weakening of the sovereignty of nation state. The last part handles the effect of the process of globalization on Turkey, and present the fact that Turkey, as a nation state, is influenced by this process in a way that it even threatens Turkey’s power of sovereignty. The last part also shows how Turkey should follow a path in order to avoid any harm caused by the global order and make use of any opportunity appearing under present circumstances.

Title:  Impact of strategic factors on enterprise resource planning implementations
Abstract:  Deciding on the Enterprise Resource Planning system, determining the business needs and determining the Enterprise Resource Planning strategies is a very important issue. The fact that the strategies created by the businesses are simple and understandable to all employees, also has a critical prescription on the success of the Enterprise Resource Planning system implementation. It is very useful for the continuity of the system to conduct a model study on the necessity of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system of enterprises. However, success factors that are important during the election phase may be useful on the success of the system throughout the implementation process. This study aimed to investigate the strategic factors during and after the implementation of ERP system by using survey method. Before the implementation of ERP systems, tactical decisions of the vendor selection, the employee training, determination of the project manager, and the method implementation should be taken. Selection of the method of implementation is very important step. Ignoring this step will reduce the probability of success in the ERP implementation.

Title:  Evaluation of agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria
Abstract:  This article presents a holistic approach for assessing agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria based on its economic, social and ecological aspects on sectoral macro-level. It is based on official statistical and other information as well as on expert evaluation. Our study has found that the Bulgarian agriculture on macro-level has good sustainability. Some of the sustainability aspects have higher levels such as the economic aspect, while others like social and environmental aspects are inferior. Study results could help in focusing the political efforts, so that the agrarian sustainability, in its social and ecological aspect, could be increased. However, a further research is needed to evaluate the level of sustainability at micro-level, so that the major issues and problem areas are addressed accordingly.

Title:  Examination of The Factors Effective in The use of the e-government system with the technology acceptance model
Abstract:   In this study, it was aimed to determine the factors affecting user behaviors in adopting the e-government system with the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model used in the literature. In this regard, 5500 academic and administrative staff working at Atatürk and Gümüþhane universities were included in the study using the questionnaire. In consequence of the survey application, 463 questionnaires were analyzed. The Cronbach Alpha Coefficient method was used for the reliability, and the Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used for the validity of the research scales. After determining the reliability and validity of the scales, research hypotheses were tested by the Structural Equation Model. According to the analysis results, in the first model of the study, anxiety has a negative impact on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. On the other hand, results showed that reliance has no significant effect on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Furthermore, it has been obtained that perceived usefulness is the most important factor for the attitude with a rate of 69.2%. In the second model of the study, it has been obtained that self-efficacy is the most important factor for the perceived behavior control with a rate of 82.3% and perceived behavior control is the most important factor for the perceived behavior control with a rate of 75.6%. Moreover, the actual behavior factor for adopting the e-government system in the first model was explained with more percentage than the second model.

Title:  Economic prospects and current situation of the planter manufacturing industry in Mexico
Abstract:  Mexico imports 14 million pesos in seeders of which 53% is from the United States, 16.6% from France, 11.4 from Italy, 8.7 from Brazil, 5.5% from Spain and 4.7% from others countries. Donoso 2007. It is estimated that there is a market of Seeders of about 3,000 machines/year. About 1800 imported and another 1200 of national manufacture, of them 500 of Direct Sowing approximately. The objective of this work is to analyze the situation of the planter manufacturing industry and its economic prospects for the future in Mexico. Mexico in the segment of planters unlike the segments of tractors and combine harvesters, in which in the first only meet manufacturers and in the second it does not even exist in the country, has a national industry of manufacturing of planters strongly rooted in the country with its own technology. This situation was evidenced by not allowing the emergence of Argentine planters, as well as infrastructure to continue the research and development of new designs of seeders in the four agricultural institutions led by the Universidad Autonoma Chapingo. It must be invested in Precision Agriculture technology With seeders with intelligent metering so as not to be left behind this industry. If this condition is put into practice the economic outlook is very encouraging for this segment of the national agricultural machinery industry.

Title:  Economics and how Obama could have lost the 2016 election too
Abstract:  During the 2016 U.S. election, many voters from democratic (‘blue wall’)states, which have voted consistently in the past elections for the democrats, suddenly moved back into the Republican fold.  During this election, the primary economic issue was supposed to be NAFTA, both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump claimed it has been responsible for U.S. manufacturing job losses. So, what is the effect of trade on personal income and in particular manufacturing income and employment? Still, manufacturing losses are unlikely to explain democratic losses in rural areas, such as Wisconsin, where farm voters switched parties. What is the relationship between farm income and election result? Finally, are farmers Republican, Democrat or Independent?  Or just pragmatic?

Title:  The Fishbone diagram to identify, systematize and analyze the sources of general purpose technologies
Abstract:  This study suggests the fishbone diagram for technological analysis. Fishbone diagram (also called Ishikawa diagrams or cause-and-effect diagrams) is a graphical technique to show the several causes of a specific event or phenomenon. In particular, a fishbone diagram (the shape is similar to a fish skeleton) is a common tool used for a cause and effect analysis to identify a complex interplay of causes for a specific problem or event. The fishbone diagram can be a comprehensive theoretical framework to represent and analyze the sources of innovation. Fishbone diagram is applied here as a novel graphical representation to identify, explore and analyse whenever possible, the potential root causes of the source and evolution of General Purpose Technologies (GPTs). Overall, then, fishbone diagram seems to be an appropriate and general technique of graphical representation to explore and categorize, clearly and simply, the potential root causes of the evolution of technological innovations for an appropriate management of technology.

Title:  The factors affecting of digital mobile e-learning on development in senior high schools
Abstract:  The traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) model ignores the cooperative relationship among decision-making units (DMUs), so it is difficult to evaluate the DMUs efficiency reasonably. In this study, we use a cross-efficiency and bootstrap truncated regression (BTR) model to analyze the determining factors of digital mobile e-learning. The empirical results of this research indicate the following results: (1) Importing digital mobile e-learning can really enhance the efficiency of school management. (2) The school size, tablet PC numbers, total equipment expenses associated with tablet PC and school location are important determinants for affecting the efficiency of school management. Owing to the government is full implementation of the new learns model, that is, to be where the students able to experience the authentic joy of new learning model and attract students join. The result of the study suggested that in order to increase the school’s cross-efficiency model efficiency. The first assist the school in upgrading the Wi-Fi technology and network equipment. In general, the school adds to the Wi-Fi technology and network equipment. That would enlarge the school network and as to attract more school will adopt the new learning. It is where the students able to experience the authentic joy of new learning model and attract students join. Thus, the schools will increase school size. However, it should be noted that total equipment expenses associated with tablet PC have the negative influence on school management efficiency due to the increasing costs for furnishing the related internet and network equipment or device to facilitate for teaching and learning among teachers and students by digital mobile e-learning. The results of this research can also be the reference for educational authorities when formulating policies and regulations for promoting digital mobile e-learning in high school in Taiwan.

Title:  Principle-agent analysis of technology project (LINCOS) in Costa Rica
Abstract:  In this paper we analyze the institutional arrangement between various actors to understand how ICT project objectives flow among actors in a standard LINCOS project and how they would affect the sustainability and effectiveness of LINCOS in particular and an ICT project in general. Since there are many actors involved in different stages and processes of a single LINCOS project, the paper analyses the bilateral and multilateral relationships among these actors to understand the factors that might affect the efficiency of the ICT project. In other words the paper looks at the actors involved in a LINCOS project in an effort to capture those circumstances under which a LINCOS project is exposed to principal- agent problems.

Title:  Diversity, emotion, and decision to implement innovation in family business
Abstract:  Family firms are generally small and medium-sized, characterized by ‘flat’ organizational structures and internal succession patterns and relying upon self-financing. One way to overcome inherent liability of family business is to innovate in critical management aspects and jump out to a new operational model. The capability of a firm to continuously innovate is critical for competitive advantage. It can also contribute to the development for the so-called dynamic capability. A firm’s dynamic capability describes to continuously innovate.

Title:  Hawking irreversibility and socio-economic derminism
Abstract:  Physicist Stephen Hawking has suggested that climate changes is about to become unstoppable. One may introduce a concept of Hawking irreversibility as the point where temperature has risen so much that the global warming consequences threaten the survival of mankind. The recent news out of China that its CO2s are increasing again makes this term highly policy relevant. Moreover, the methane emissions have started to augment, which also calls up Hawking irreversibility. The drive behind these dire developments is the endless zest for affluence and wealth, fueled by ever larger energy consumption.

Title:  Economics of WTO plus: No to conflict and Yes to regionalism
Abstract:  The paper makes a case for effective regionalism in South Asia by developing such conflict mitigation strategies between India and Pakistan that exploit their proximity to global trade. The welfare enhancing measures for nation states become more startling when they not only invest in institutional development but also become an active part of the global village with regionalism as a viable means to achieve this objective.

Title:  Public relations perspectives on electoral reforms as a panacea for consolidating Nigeria’s democracy
Abstract:  Electoral reforms have been considered as sustainable means of improving on the quality of elections in Nigeria, this is especially as it avails the country, tremendous opportunities in admitting new policies such as new techniques, technologies and improved systems of protecting the welfare of electorates. It is evident from the literature that, public relations overtime has been a unifying factor in accelerating Nigeria’s democracy and sustaining its need for periodic elections and encouraging the conduct of free, fair and transparent elections by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).  Based on the level of malpractices and issues associated with the conduct of elections in Nigeria, it was concluded in this paper that, there are several benefits attached to the process of electoral reforms in Nigeria, hence, it gives government the opportunity to revamp its electoral policies through campaigns, introduction of new technologies, voting and more importantly, the nature of conducting elections bearing in mind that, poorly adopted electoral policies normally lead to the outbreak of crisis from aggrieved parties.  It is recommended amongst others that, government at all levels should consider periodic electoral reforms as a strategy for development and as such; they should ensure that only people with credibility are charged with the mandate of presiding over electoral reform committees (ERC).

Title:  Upgrading school efficiencies and learning interests through innovative teaching of digital mobile e-learning
Abstract:  Assessing the digital mobile e-learning whether to affect school efficiency is an important yet complex issue. Consequently, this study goal of this research is to evaluate the innovative teaching to affect school efficiency (total efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE) and scale efficiency (SE) estimated by the data envelopment analysis (DEA) through using digital mobile e-learning of high school in Taiwan. Additionally, the Tobit regression model (TRM) is employed to discuss whether the other determinants affect using digital mobile e-learning of school efficiency. The findings can briefly be concluded as follows. The empirical results of this research indicate the following results: (1) Importing digital mobile e-learning can really enhance the efficiency of school management. (2) technical Efficiency (TE), pure technical efficiency (PTE) and scale efficiency (SE) in the TRM analysis, it also indicates that school size, teacher-student ratio, school high-vocational attribute, especially the numbers of technical teachers in teaching or consulting about digital mobile e-learning knowledge and numbers of Tablet PC (the proxy for digital mobile e-learning) an important role in affecting these three efficiency of school management. Besides, the results show of total equipment expenses associated with tablet PC has a small negative influence on school management efficiency. Due to increasing costs for network equipment small effects on teaching and learning among teachers and students. The results of this research can also be the reference for educational authorities when formulating policies and regulations for promoting digital mobile e-learning.

Title:  Differences in wealth, education, and history
Abstract:  An understanding of the freedoms (or the lack of freedoms) and their economic consequences on early black Americans provides an informative understanding to the freedoms (or the lack of freedoms), and their economic consequences on other, modern ethnic groups. Curtis (2017) investigates the link between the social asymmetry and economic asymmetry among early blacks and whites in the United States of America. For the empirical study,  Curtis (2017) uses cross-sectional variables from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Sample (IPUMS), developed informative conditional ratios, and employed least squares statistical analyses. This study finds that economic differences among ethnic groups, as measured by differences between early blacks and whites, are intertwined with asymmetrical freedoms, leading to statistically insignificant returns to education, as measured by literacy. One might conclude that the individual’s basic protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must proceed any expectations of measured returns to schooling, particularly among individuals in disenfranchised groups. Furthermore, one might propose education policy such that modern higher education investment programs prioritize education entrepreneurs and/or state/social planners with academic research familiarity of differences in wealth.

Title:  A journey to entrepreneurship: Converting a dream into reality - A case study
Abstract:  Owning one’s own business is the realization of the dreams of many ambitious young men and women. However, business ownership has its rewards and challenges. The rewards are often financial and non-financial. It is one of the best means of wealth creation, but it can be a big disappointment and could have disastrous consequences if the entrepreneur chooses the wrong product/service, does not prepare a complete and realistic business plan, or is not adequately prepared to react to unanticipated difficulties and challenges. The subject in this case, Uchechi Tatsa, is contemplating starting an import business, and trying to prepare the necessary plans that would be appealing enough to a venture capital firm to provide needed seed money.  Thus, this case focuses on the planning phase in entrepreneurships, and the ability of a young entrepreneur, with no prior business experience, to create and run a new venture. It is written for potential entrepreneurs and students in Entrepreneurship and introductory business classes.

Title:  Types of government and innovative performance of countries
Abstract:  The present study endeavours to explain the differences of technological performances among nations. In particular, the paper analyses the relation between type of government of nations, and their technological and socioeconomic performances. Results suggest that high levels of technological performance of nations seem to be associated with executive with parliamentary monarchy and monarchy, whereas nations with mixed executive tend to have lower innovative outputs. A possible reason is that, in general, some typologies of executive (e.g., Monarchy) support the political stability of countries with fruitful socioeconomic developmental paths over the long run. Overall, then, the structure of executives of nations may be one of contributing factors to explain dissimilar patterns of technological performances and economic growth of nations over time and space.

Title:  Cinema semiotics: An application of Hodge and Tripp’s Paradigm/Syntagm approach
Abstract:  Various scholars have defined the term semiotics according to their understanding but with a unifying central meaning which is the study of signs. Two important aspects of semiotics are syntagm and paradigm. The organization of signs by chain is referred to as syntagm, while by choice it is referred to as paradigm. According to Hodge & Tripp (1986), as far as syntagmatic structures are concerned, texts are examined from three different angles or variables: space, time, and continuity. Moreover, in film the interpretations of individual, shots depend on both paradigmatic analysis (comparing it, not necessarily, with the use of alternative kinds of shots) and syntagmatic analysis (comparing it with preceding and following shots). This paper, applies the concept of Syntagm and Paradigm given by Hodge and Tripp to analyse the structure of two films from Nigeria’s film industries i.e. Kanywood and Nollywood industries.

Title:  Globalization under hysteresis: A study of Eastern Bloc Countries, China and India
Abstract:  This study is concerned with a great socio-economic experiment in history that replaced the naturally evolved market economy with the humanly designed command economy to achieve a socialist triumph over capitalism, experienced a setback and ultimately returned to the market economy for managing the material aspects of the society. Efforts to open the subject economies in the aftermath of the said experiment are on the contemporary agenda worldwide. Yet, the past pulls the present causing hysteresis that thwarts the momentum of globalization. Using KOF and AEMC indices of globalization (based on KOF data 1991-2014), the paper concludes that most of the countries to the south of Russian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan) have performed rather poorly in globalization efforts. On the other hand, the countries in the north-western side of the Russian Federation (except Moldova) have on the whole performed better. In comparison, China has performed fairly while India lags behind. In spite of all proclamations, unless the political will to globalization is there, globalization cannot progress much further. However, such a political will has not been strong in India. India has remained protectionist of vested interests of politicians, industrialists, business houses and perhaps the intelligentsia, a coalition of the dominant proprietary classes that benefit from the status quo or stagnancy of the Indian economy and society. Globalization in India is under a strong spell of hysteresis on account of the pre-1991 pseudo-socialistic nostalgia as well as age-old internal contradictions.

Title:  Awareness about diabetes risk factors and prevention strategies among women of Punjab
Abstract:  Diabetes is a huge challenge to country’s health and economy. It has been widely debated that in order to reduce the incidence and consequences of diabetes, its awareness among the masses is pre-requisite. Thereby, in the present paper an attempt has been made to examine the awareness of the risk factors and preventive strategies of diabetes among women. The study was based on primary data collected from 200 women from Jalandhar. The analysis of the data has been made with the help of frequencies, percentages and weighted average score. It has been found that 96 percent of the women were aware of diabetes.  However, only 42 percent, 30 percent, 22 percent, 13 percent and 29 percent were aware of prevention of diabetes, vaccine for diabetes, complete cure for diabetes and susceptibility of diabetes. These figures are compelling enough to stimulate government to decide to take corrective actions to address the awareness of diabetes among women. It was also found the awareness of the risk factors and preventive measures was low among the sampled respondents. Need of the hour is to create awareness of diabetes, risk factors and lifestyle changes which can prevent or delay diabetes.

Title: Economic thought in Eighteenth Century America prior to independence
Abstract: This paper examines the state of economic thought in the United States during the time period 1700 to 1775, an era that marks the end of the colonial age for the new nation.  This essay starts with an over view of economic conditions during the final phase of colonialism in America.  This is followed by a discussion of American economic thinking, divided into three distinct yet overlapping perspectives: (1) mainstream economic thought, which represents the dominant point of view about economics in America prior to the end of colonial status; (2) other voices, or economic perspectives focused on particular economic issues of the time and not the general state of economic thought; and (3) a crosscurrent or contrary view to mainstream economics, a way of viewing economics and economic thinking that takes exception to the popular economic paradigm of the time.
