Title:  The Contradictions of Free Market System and The Impacts of FDI and Foreign Trade on Economy
Abstract:  This paper examines the effects of the FDI and foreign trade (Exports and Imports) as well as their importance in international economic activities. A central subject the study is to examine the impact of FDI and foreign trade on the growth and prosperity status of countries. Whereby the paper examines the role of international business on the developing progress of countries. The economic growth of a country depends on the quantity and productivity of the economic factors. For that reason FDI and Import-Export are most significant economic activities, which have substantial effects on the quantity as well as quality of economic factors in any country.  On the other side, customs union, quotas and regional trade pacts deactivate partly or in some cases even completely the projected effects of Smith’s absolute and Ricardo’s comparative advantages theories in the international production cooperation. The study examines this situation from a modern economic point of view.

Title:  Export Price Stability and Compatibility of Euro under the Export- Biased Productivity Growth in Turkey: A Criticism against the Maastricht Inflation Criterion
Abstract:  In this work, we analyzed the export- biased productivity, wage growth and the ULCP in Turkey. Then, by using input- output methods , we could show that Turkey has an economy which is able to be a part of the Euro system and Euro is compatible under the export- biased productivity growth in Turkey though its relatively high inflation. That means Maastricht inflation criterion should be revised in terms of countries’ economic performance.

Title:  Reflections on Chinese Political Economy
Abstract:  The aim of this paper is to discuss the reasons for the rapid growth in the Chinese economy over the last three decades. China has been growing fastest in human history, which has an impact on the global economy and also various challenges that the country faces. It is seen as heralding a major shift in the international division of labour through changes in its output and employment pattern. China is described as becoming the “work-shop” of the world as a result of the expansion of its manufacturing production. Its impact on other Asian economies and also on the world economy has the potential to be enormous. Market reforms and opening up of the Chinese economy to trade and foreign capital since the early 1980s, have unleashed entrepreneurial energies. China’s development policies can be best understood if these are looked at from an institutional economic perspective. This article is based on a review of published papers in the field of economic policies, focusing on the debate concerning the respective roles of the state and the market. A wide range of data sources are presented, including statistics compiled and generated by wide range of organisations such as IMF, World Bank and WTO that are non-governmental agencies. Secondary data of this type provides greater potential for addressing the research questions than statistics produced by the national government. This study finds that corporate debt has risen in recent years in China, a large part of these loans having been financed with investment in trust products issued by the banks. In addition, a huge amount of credit has been channelled into the real estate sector, and seems to be heading towards the housing and estate sectors, meaning that most of this is speculative. Investments are financed by credit; which clearly needs to be repaid. If these levels of debt become unsustainable this could pose a major challenge for the Chinese economy.

Title:  Growth and Prospects of Agro-Processing Industries in Punjab
Abstract:  Present study attempts to examine the growth and prospects of agro-processing industries in Punjab in the post liberalization period. Punjab that used to perform reasonably well in terms of industrialization, few years back, is today facing the industrial crunch owing to obvious reasons. Keeping present trends in mind, the state needs to emulate the growth path adopted by China, explicitly, wherein thrust to development had been on the manufacturing sector. With availability of food grain production round the year, it seems viable also in the state to develop the agro processing industries. In fact, researchers have pointed out that Punjab’s agriculture has reached a stage where its sustainability is in doubt. If such apprehensions turn out to be true, then future of masses will also land in darkness. Development of agro-processing industries at this juncture, are perceived to be the stimulator that can revamp the vanished glory of the state. The study is an attempt made through empirical framework to find out the conditions for the development of agro-processing industries in the state.

Title:  Features of Formation of the National Income
Abstract:  Significant indicator of economic progress of the country is the specific income per capita. Experts consider such indicator important from the point of view of forecasting of economic development. Influence of various factors is presented in references, but influence of psychological indicators, in particular, influence of personal characteristics of the population isn't considered. On material of the population of various countries of the world features of formation of the national specific income per capita are considered. The assumption that a measure of professional qualities is linear superposition of level of competence, creative abilities and specific national wealth is made. For simplification of the analysis the sum of these indicators were used as a superposition prototype to a first approximation. It is established that the sum of competence-based indicators, factors of creative opportunities and an indicator of national wealth per capita forms a specialized indicator. It is revealed that this indicator is connected with specific GNP per capita on dependence with high coefficient of correlation. Dependence linearization increases this coefficient to 0.949. It is established that in process of the movement in a zone of the countries with more considerable development of economy, influence of this indicator increases as dependence in an initial look has square character.

Title:  Analysis of the Development of Accounting in Kosovo
Abstract:  This research aims to describe the Kosovo’s accounting regime by comparing its previous and present status which is developed a lot during recent years. The developments occurred because of the need to track and record accounting information in an efficient way toward the purpose of decreasing the violation of government regulations and increasing the consciousness of accountants in this field. Therefore it is crucial for the accounting system to function in an appropriate way, because it is directly related to the economical development and good organization of the financial market in the state of Kosovo. Since the state is still passing through the period of transition, many changes have occurred on the principles of the accounting system.The methodology used while making this research is the semi-structured interviewing. By this method the literature of Kosovo was reviewed and the results and findings are based on consultations with business firms, professionals at the field of accounting and also books related to accounting development.The final results obtained through this research clarify the situation of development of the accounting system in Kosovo and it explains that there is a huge difference between the previous and current accounting performance which is highly noticeable and that the present status is satisfactory.

Title:  Role of Remittance for Improving Quality of Life: Evidence from Bangladesh
Abstract:  Remittance is a considerable source to influence the national economy. As the growing volume of remittance earning has positive impact on income, growth and poverty reduction, the potential contribution for improving quality of life of the domestic people need to be investigated. The main objective of the study was to analyse the contribution of remittance earning on the quality of life in Bangladesh. For the quality of life, HDI index, extensively accepted index consisting income, education and life expectancy, is used. This study covers the data for HDI and remittance earning from 1981 to 2011. The study employed the VEC (Vector Error Correction) model to analysis the desired relation between the variables. The estimated result shows the long run causality running from remittance to HDI. This result implies that the remittance has an influence on the quality of living in long run. To improve the quality of life, the government have the better choice to emphasis on the bottom level people for emigration after suitable training so that they can earn more; consequently send more remittances to their home country.

Title:  Effects of Trade Facilitation on Inequality: A Case Study of Sub-Sahara Africa
Abstract:  Inequality in the sub-Saharan Africa has been on the high side compared to other regions of the world. The policy makers in the region are aware of this and have implemented several policies to stem it. Among the solutions is inclusive growth and strong trade reforms. However, the trade position is still not encouraging even though it is rising.  One major factor inhibiting trade and hence inequality is costs attached to the movement of goods across border, that is, trade facilitation. This study investigated the effectiveness of trade facilitation on inequality in a panel of 38 SSA countries spanning from 2005 to 2012. The results show that not all trade facilitation variables contribute to reduction in inequality. While reduction in time required to export significantly reduce inequality, time required to import, and to set up a new business worsened inequality. Custom efficiency is effective and has positive impact on inequality, that is, inequality is less, and the more efficient Customs are. Following these findings, authorities in the region will do well in addressing inequality issues by paying more attention to transaction challenges facing exports and custom efficiencies.

Title:  Severity and Controllability of Service Failures as Perceived by Passengers in Airline Industry
Abstract:  Service delivery is inherently failure prone. Providing “zero defects” services should be the desired objective of all service providers, but problems are unavoidable in the service industry mainly due to the unique characteristics of services (Parasuraman et al., 1985).The characteristics and the typology of the complaints have been studied in fragmented manner (McCollough, 2009). Hence, this research has the following objectives: To find the severity and controllability of the complaint situations as perceived by airline passengers. To classify the complaint situations based on severity and controllability. To find the association between the typology of complaints, namely, process related and outcome related to the characteristics of severity and controllability. In the first stage, the research methodology wasin-depth exploratory interviews with officials of eight airlines. Situations of common complaints were collected and integrated with those in the literature to develop inventory of complaints. An instrument was developed to classify the complaint situation based on perceived severity and controllability. The findings have managerial implications of guiding the officials in assessment of the severity and controllability of the process and outcome related situations.

Title:  Alexander Brem & Éric Viardot (eds.), Adoption of Innovation: Balancing Internal and External Stakeholders in the Marketing of Innovation
Abstract:  The Adoption of Innovation:Balancing Internal and External Stakeholders in the Marketing of Innovation book edited by Alexander Brem & Éric Viardot provides a contemporary look at innovation from a marketing point of view. Innovation has been a hot topic both for academicians and managers for the last twenty years may well remain an area of interest for years to come. The title of the book emphasizes basic topics that are covered in the book but it hardly represents whole coverage of the book. Each of the eleven chapters discusses a distinct aspect of innovation in marketing related issues. In this way the book offers its readers interested in a specific area an effective way of welcoming different aspects of it and helps in enabling the development of more comprehensive approaches to innovation. The research areas revealed throughout the book includes innovation and internal & external stakeholders, adoption of innovation, business model innovations, corporate vision and innovation. Comprehensive coverage of the book and up-to-date research carried out in diverse settings such as space ventures may be considered the basic strengths of the book. On the other hand, each chapter presented is a standalone study and consequently there are no cross-references between the chapters. This creates a certain degree of disparity and can be considered as the major weakness of the book.

Title:  Alternative Measures of Credit Extension for Countercyclical Buffer Decisions in South Africa
Abstract:   This paper analyses the behaviour of alternative measures of credit extension for countercyclical buffer decisions in South Africa. These measures include the deviation of the ratio of private sector credit extension to gross domestic product from its long term trend, the deviation of the logarithm of private sector credit extension from its long term trend as well as the annual percentage change in private sector credit extension. The cyclical properties of these measures are examined over the economic and the financial cycles. The results show that the deviation of the ratio of private sector credit extension to gross domestic product from its long term trend is countercyclical with the economic cycle. The results further show that the deviation of the logarithm of private sector credit extension from its long term trend is procyclical with both the economic and the financial cycle. The results finally show that the annual percentage change in private sector credit extension generally performs poorly in cyclical terms with both the economic and the financial cycle. Consequently, of the three alternative measures of private sector credit extension considered, the deviation of the logarithm of private sector credit extension from its long term trend could be used as a common reference guide for implementing the countercyclical capital buffers for financial institutions in South Africa.

Title:  Fiscal Policy and Economic Growth, Empirical Evidence in European Union
Abstract:  The role of Fiscal policy in the long run growth process has been crucial in macroeconomics since the appearance of endogenous growth models. Additionally, a significant debate among economists involves whether several types of spending or taxation enhance economic growth. The main objective of this paper is to highlight the relationship between fiscal policy and economic growth in the EU-15, and make an attempt to determine which of the fiscal policy instruments enhance economic growth.We deployed panel data techniques and included both sides of budget, spending and taxation, in our regressions and used the most recent dataset data for fiscal variables from Eurostat. We made a new classification of public expenditures into homogeneous groups in order to reduce the explanatory variables and increase the efficiency of our model and results since we have data for only 14 years. In our empirical analysis we included OLS, fixed effects models, random effects models and GMM estimators, the Arellano and Bond (1991) and the Arellano and Bover (1995) - Blundell and Bond (1998) estimators.On the first round of our regressions we find a negative impact of spending on human capital accumulation on economic growth. Our empirical results also indicate that an increase on government spending on infrastructure has a significant positive impact on the economy growth of a country. Additionally, in our regressions the variable government spending on property rights protections include spending on defence and spending on public order safety. Our empirical results from the first round of regressions imply a strongly negative relationship between these two variables. However, on the second round of our regressions we aggregate defence spending from spending on property right protection and we did not find any relationship between economic growth and defence spending. Moreover, we found a non-significant relationship between government spending on social protection and economic growth. On the second round of regressions, when we allow for non-linear growth effects we find a positive relationship with deficits and economic growth, which is in contrast with Ricardian Equivalence. We also included the employment growth and business investment in our model because labour and capital are very important factors of production in growth models. In our empirical results we do not find a significant impact of employment on economic growth, but when we allow for non-linear growth effects we find a strongly positive impact. However, we found that gross fixed capital formation of the private sector as a percentage of GDP in both rounds of our regressions, has no significant impact on economic growth. Finally,our empirical results do not support any evidence of relationship between openness and economic growth.

Title:  Assessing Recent Turkey’s Foreign Trade Performance
Abstract:  Turkey`s foreign trade performance compare with its own past and with its major trading partnersincreased significantly over the last decade. This increase seems related to the growth trend of exports by geographical destinations. Recent global financial and economic crises and worsening geo–political environment challenged Turkey’s foreign trade as well. Turkey’s foreign trade increased nearly by 3–fold through exporting the risky countriessince 2003.The aim of this article is to examine Turkey’s foreign trade by focusing on increased exposures of export destinationsfor the period of 2003–2013. In this study, export destinations’ rating are used to calculate export exposure. The results suggest that finding new markets especially in neighborand least developed countries caused new risks for Turkey, increasing export exposure. This exposure can be seen in the deterioration of sovereign rating of export destinations, from A+/A to BBB. This seems to suggest that even though Turkey have increased foreign trade with the new markets, this exposure should be covered by well–designed policies as Turkey suffers from foreign trade deficit continuously. Turkey should attempt on policy reform which would increase its competitiveness in export markets and productsand thus enable it to increase its ranking in the World trade.

Title:  The Impact of Age Distribution on Household Consumption: Evidence from Saudi Arabia
Abstract:  This paper aims to analyze the impact of age distribution on household consumption at the aggregate level. For that, statistical and econometric techniques are used, such as Unit root test, Co-integration and Granger Engels causality through Vector Error Correction Model, for testing an eventual short and long run causal relationships. This study is important since it helps to develop efficient national strategies for the short and the long run according to the evolution of the demographic profile and structure. Empirical validation for the Saudi Arabian case shows that the causality’s effect differs significantly according to consider the size versus the proportion of each age group. In addition, the analysis and discussions of results for each age categories gave specific conclusions for the overtime causality effect on Saudi Arabian household final consumption.

Title:  Financial Liberalization and Economic Growth in the North Africa Region: Cointegration Panel Analysis by DOLS and FMOLS Models
Abstract:  This article aims at examining the impact of financial liberalization on the economic growth in the North African countries. The econometric study, which covers the period between 1995 and 2013, relies on a sample composed of four Northern African countries and referring to the database of the World Bank data (2013), Heritage Foundation (2013) and Financial Openness of (the Institute for international and development Economics, 2009). The estimate model of cointegration panel reveals that there is a long-term relationship between the variables. Moreover, the estimation of DOLS and FMOLS models shows that the latter is more adequate to explain the financial liberalization’s impact on the economic growth of the North African countries.

Title:  Foreign-Invested Enterprises in China
Abstract:  The objective of this study was to illustrate the development and sustainability for foreign-invested enterprises in China.Banks would react to banking regulation of Basel III. The traditional loans are very costly in capital. Banks restrict lending and treat lending as a marketing tool. Foreign-invested enterprises will be difficult to get the traditional loans. The development of peer to peer (P2P) leading perform will be targeted for the foreign-invested enterprises’ new financing channel in China and the world. Also, brand name is the key factor for enterprise survival. It represents the commercial integrity. Foreign-invested enterprises can use the concept of creating shared value (CSV) as reference to sustain their business in China.

Title:  Hans J Pasman, Risk Analysis and Control for Industrial Processes - Gas, Oil and Chemicals: A System Perspective for Assessing and Avoiding Low-Probability, High-Consequence Events
Abstract:  This book discusses high-impact low-probability risks (so-called HILP risks) in the gas &oil sector and the chemicals using industries. The text is written in an agreeable style, yet at the same time also suitable for technical experts in risk management and process safety. The book is inclusive, in the sense that a triple perspective is used and the history, the present, as well as the state-of-the-art of dealing with HILP risks is discussed. Both technical and non-technical aspects are thoroughly elaborated, and, wherever possible and useful, linked with hazardous materials data and accident scenario information. The book might be interesting for process safety specialists, but it may also be employed as a handbook or reference work in academia.
Classification-JEL: D81, L60, O30.

Title:  Tax Losses due to Shadow Economy Activities in OECD Countries from 2011 to 2013: A preliminary calculation
Abstract:  In this short paper an attempt is undertaken to calculate the tax losses which result from shadow economy activities in a country. These calculations are done for the 28 EU countries, for 3 non-EU countries and for 2 other highly-developed OECD countries. The total tax losses over all 28 EU-countries make up 450.8 billion euros or 3.6% of EU-28-GDP in 2011. In 2012 it were 457.3 billion euros or 3.5% of EU-28-GDP and in 2013 454.2 billion euros or 3.4% of EU-28-GDP. For the whole country sample used in this paper the tax losses amounted to 698.7 billion euros or 2.4% of GDP of these 33 countries in 2011. In 2012 the value of tax losses was 737.2 billion euros or 2.3% of GDP and in 2013 it was 713.1 billion euros or also 2.3% of total GDP of these 33 countries.

Title:  Unified Growth Theory Contradicted by the Absence of Takeoffs in the Gross Domestic Product
Abstract:  Data describing historical economic growth are analysed. They demonstrate convincingly that the take offs from stagnation to growth, claimed in the Unified Growth Theory, never happened. This theory is again contradicted by the same data which were used, but never properly analysed, during its formulation. The absence of the claimed takeoffs demonstrates that the postulate of the differential takeoffs is also contradicted by data. Furthermore, this analysis demonstrates that the mathematically-analysable data contradict the concept of the prolonged Malthusian stagnation, its effects on the economic growth as well as the concept of a dramatic escape from the Malthusian trap.

Title:  An Approach to Assess Sustainability of Agricultural Farms
Abstract:  This paper gives an answer to important questions such as: “what is sustainability of farms?” and “how to assess sustainability of farms?”. First, evolution of the “concept” and the major approaches for assessing sustainability of farms is discussed. More adequate definition of the farm sustainability is suggested as ability of a particular farm to maintain its governance, economic, social and ecological functions in a long term. Next, a specific for the conditions of Bulgarian farms framework for assessing farm sustainability is proposed. The later includes a system of appropriate principles, criteria, indicators, and reference values for evaluating governance, economic, ecological and social aspects of farms sustainability as well as an approach for their integration and interpretation. The ultimate objective of this study is to work out an effective framework for assessing sustainability of farms in the specific economic, institutional and natural environment of farms of different types and location, assist farm management and strategies, and agricultural policies and forms of public intervention in agriculture.

Title:  Wealth-In-Utility and Time-Consistent Growth: Real Excursions with an “Overlapping” Welfare Function
Abstract:  This research explores the dynamic potential of point-wise utility functions optimization of representative agent economies. Such functions were generically considered to depend upon current consumption and wealth to be made available for next period usage or income generation, implying an endogenous (pseudo-)rate of time preference. At first inspection, the framework reproduced closely the dynamics and steady-state properties of the traditional Solow-Swan and Ramsey models – with population growth, exogenous technical progress, land, or increasing returns to scale - as well as, when human capital/knowledge was introduced, the Lucas-Uzawa endogenous growth set-up. General uncertainty – simulated at different decision stages - resulted in intuitively appealing solutions. Overlapping optimization of the capital stock generated forward-looking recursive dynamics. Homothetic preferences (CES or generalized Cobb-Douglas) - implying a constant consumption-(lead)wealth ratio along an optimal path and resulting in steady-state saving rates independent of CRS technologies features in simple structures -, were assumed for illustration, and also generic separable forms in the arguments. The latter were useful under uncertainty, allowing the inspection of the role of risk-aversion and diminishing marginal returns to capital in equilibrium and steady-state determination.

Title:  Econo- and Socio- Physics based Remarks on the Economical Growth of the World
Abstract:  It has been shown that the long term evolution of the Gross Product of the World after World War II can be well portrayed by the simply exponential function with the crossover at the year 1973, which coincides with the Oil Crisis onset. For such basic parameter as the S&P 500 index the single exponential behavior extends down to at least the mid of the nineteen century. It is notable that the detailed short-term insight focused on the last quarter of century revealed the emergence of the power like dependence, despite notable irregularities.  However, such dependences can be introduced only when taking into account the behavior at reference-baselines years, clearly related to the society – important events in the past. The possible relationship to the growth/death evolution of microorganisms is also discussed.

Title:  The Role of Information Technology in Patient Satisfaction
Abstract:  Competition comes into prominence in health field as it is in all the fields in the world and in Turkey. The companies pursue the recently established information systems and market fit closely in order to increase the competitive power. Turkey is experiencing quite radical transformations in health-care sector during the last 10 years. In this sense, the objective of the study is to determine the usage level of Central Physician Appointment System (CPAS) within the scope of technology acceptance model. When the context of the model is examined, the degree of turning the positive perceptions such as benefits, convenience that the customers perceive from this technology when they came face to face with this technology, to attitudes and behaviors is measured. As a result of the research, the electronic appointment system, which has started to be applied within the health-care sector, was considered positively on the basis of benefits and convenience and in parallel with this the their attitudes behaviors were affected positively.

Title:  The Political Economy of Free Trade, WTO and the Developing Countries
Abstract:  This paper examines the existing literature on trade liberalisation and itseffect on the economies of developing countries. It will also briefly examine the theory of comparative advantage which is seen as justification for global trade liberalisation under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation. This process is also associated with greater openness, economic interdependence and deepening economic integration with the world economy. The study is important because once again the international institutions strongly advocate trade and financial liberalisation in developing countries. The proponents of trade liberalisation argue that multilateral trade negotiations would achieve these goals, and poor countries particularly would benefit from it. However, such policies may increase vulnerability and make developing countries further hostages of international finance capital. Adoption of open market policies in agriculture would also mean the abandoning of self-reliance and food sovereignty, which may have wider consequences in terms of food shortages, food prices and rural employment.

Title:  Consumer Credit, Oil Prices, and the U.S. Economy
Abstract:  Have you paid cash to fill up your gas tank lately?  Probably not and I argue this is one reason why the U.S. economy appears to have become less sensitive to changes in the price of oil. When gas prices rise drivers have increasingly been able to borrow and firms able to offer incentives making immediate reductions in the purchases of groceries, electronics, cars, and other goods smaller than in the past.  This alters the relationship between oil prices and U.S. economic activity, but does not eliminate it the money must be paid back after all.

Title:  Population Growth and Economic Growth Performance in Nigeria (1981 – 2014)
Abstract:  There has been intense debate in the literature on the role of population growth in economic growth performance. Some scholars believe that increases in the population of a nation tantamount to economic progress, others see population increase as a curse rather than a blessing, but a few scholars also believe that population assumes a neutral position in economic growth process.  This paper therefore sought to assess the role of population growth in economic growth performance in Nigeria. The study employed time series data for the period 1981-2013. Using Augmented Cobb-Douglass Production Function (gleaning from Solow Growth Model), and relying on error correction modelling framework, the econometric results established the fact that population growth has the potentials of fostering economic growth in Nigeria, but underlined the fact that this and other benefits would depend on, not only the chunk of the entire population that is active, but the quality of the population. Amongst other policy options suggested, it was advocated that policy measures that will foster target-oriented and skill-enhancing education and training should be designed and implemented. Provision of accessible and affordable healthcare for a healthy population was also advocated if Nigeria’s population growth must be advantageous.

Title:  Forecasting Daily Stock Volatility Using GARCH-CJ Type Models with Continuous and Jump Variation
Abstract:  In this paper we decompose the realized volatility of the GARCH-RV model into continuous sample path variation and discontinuous jump variation to provide a practical and robust framework for non- parametrically measuring the jump component in asset return volatility. By using 5-minute high-frequency data of MASI Index in Morocco for the period (January 15, 2010 - January 29, 2016), we estimate parameters of the constructed GARCH and EGARCH-type models (namely, GARCH, GARCH-RV, GARCH-CJ, EGARCH, EGARCH-RV, and EGARCH-CJ) and evaluate their predictive power to forecast future volatility.  The results show that the realized volatility and the continuous sample path variation have certain predictive power for future volatility while the discontinuous jump variation contains relatively less information for forecasting volatility. More interestingly, the findings show that the GARCH-CJ-type models have stronger predictive power for future volatility than the other two types of models. These results have a major contribution in financial practices such as financial derivatives pricing, capital asset pricing, and risk measures.

Title:  Borrowers’ Participation in Group Borrowing
Abstract:  Borrowers’ participation in MFI group lending credit market is not insured because of the alternative sources of credit available. The question arises what is the ideal MFI interest rate to ensure borrowers’ participation which at the same time being financially viable for MFI. The paper attempts to answer this question and analyzes the borrowers’ trade-off of borrowing from MFI or from moneylender (ML). Results show that borrowers may find comparative advantage in borrowing individually from ML as compared to borrowing in a group from MFI if the transaction cost burden is high and their credit requirement is low.

Title:  Impact of the Revised Malaysian Code on Corporate Governance on Audit Committee Attributes and Firm Performance
Abstract:  Using a sample of 37 finance companies listed under the finance segment of Bursa Malaysia, we examined the impact of the revision to Malaysian code on corporate governance on audit committee attributes and firm performance. Our result suggests that audit committee attributes significantly improved after the Code was revised. In addition, the coefficient for audit committee and risk committee interlock has a significant negative relationship with Tobin’s Q in the period before the revision to the Code and before the global financial crisis. The negative direction of the result is contrary to agency theory which suggests that separating directors on subcommittees will create information asymmetry between the directors and lead to poor coordination in the decisions of the committees thereby negatively affecting firm performance.

Title:  The Institutional Fundamentals of Turkey's Economic Performance: A New Institutional Perspective
Abstract:  In this thesis, the effect of Turkey's institutional structure on economic performance is analyzed by using transaction cost and credible commitment which are contributed by New Institutional Economics. According to this school, neoclassical economics ignores transaction cost, bounded rationality, incomplete contracts and property rights. So these models will not represent the real world. But it's known that the transaction cost is always positive in the real world. According to this reality, to begin with the institutions containing the New Institutional Economics are investigated and the relationship between institutions and economic performance is explained. Afterwards defining, measuring and effects of transaction cost topics are mentioned. Soon after we handled the political transaction cost. In the next chapter, the policymaking process and credible commitment are explained. The role of institutions on formation of institutional policies and the 3 determiner legislative-executive-judiciary and the seperation of powers are discussed and credible commitment is clarified in this context. By giving the theoretical framework of this issues, Turkey's progress is reviewed. The important contribution of this thesis is by following New Institutional Economics perspective, first defining the political transaction cost and credible commitment and after showing the effects Turkey's institutional structure to economic performance by using time series analysis with structral breaks. Findings indicate that the transaction cost and credible commitment determined by institutional structure are highly important on investment decisions and national income.

Title:  Social Municipality Perception in Turkey: A Case Study in the Istanbul, Izmir, Adana, Diyarbakýr Metropolitan Municipalities
Abstract:  Social municipality, in the broadest sense, can be defined as an approach, to develop citizen and community-based practices where municipalities focuses on human on its policies. Tracks of this mentality in Turkey dates back to 90's when approach expanded its impact area with personal efforts of some mayors and has been accepted as an vital element of policy on promotion and competition of cities. Social municipality applications mostly shaped as social aids, social services and cultural activities. The purpose of this thesis is to detect the scope of the social municipality based services which has been performed by metropolitan municipalities and also defining the perception and attitude of the beneficiaries and practitioners toward those services. To achieve this purpose, a literature review about social state/welfare state, social politics and social municipality presented. Followingly had explained social municipality based services which has conducted by metropolitan municipalities. Finally, data obtained from the field research was analyzed with frequency distributions, one-sample t-test, two independent samples t-test and chi-square tests by using SPSS package software. At the end of study, it was found that scope of social services varies between metropolitan municipalities, however faced problems look similar. And also significant perceptional and attitudinal differences found between beneficiaries and practitioners toward social municipality based services.

Title:  Soft Power as a Effect Instruments in Foreign Policy: Turkey's Soft Power Analysis and the Assessment of its Soft Power Capacity on Azerbaijan
Abstract:  With the emergence of first political structures of the world, struggles between them gave rise to the concept of power. Since the ancient times, power has played an important role in the concept of international relations and made a significant contribution to the establishment of the discipline as an autonomous structure. The concept of power, which has always maintained its importance, has evolved in time and, for the time being, is known for its rather soft side. In this century, many academic studies that dealt with the soft side of the power have been published, however, while being mentioned in popular publications, the concept has not been favored in the academic publications in Turkey. With this dissertation that is the first study that deals with the soft power within the context of international relations, we intended to contribute to the filling of the void in the Turkish literature. For this purpose, we first discussed the concept of power and the soft power in every aspect. Afterwards, we analyzed the soft power potential of Turkey culturally, politically and within the frame of foreign affairs practices and essentially in the context of Middle East, Caucasus and Central Asia regions. As the soft power sources that may influence the national politics may vary for every country, we chose Azerbaijan as the model of this study and sought for an answer to the question, "How Turkey can possibly/efficiently have the soft power influence over Azerbaijan?". As the hypothesis of the study and the answer of the question, we considered the cultural link between these two countries would constitute the most important and effective soft power source. In the conclusion of the study, we interviewed a group of fifteen Azerbaijanis that consisted NGO members, journalists and academicians thus proved the hypothesis of the study.

Title:  Estimating the Size of the Shadow Economy: Methods, Problems and Open Questions
Abstract:  This paper presents various methods for estimating the size of the shadow economy and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses. The purpose of the paper is twofold. Firstly, it demonstrates that no ideal method exists to estimate the size and development of the shadow economy. Because of its flexibility, the MIMIC method used to get macro-estimates of the size of the shadow economy is discussed in greater detail. Secondly, the paper focuses on the definition and causal factors of the shadow economy and provides a comparison of the size of the shadow economy using different estimation methods.

Title:  Austerity, Cyclical Adjustment and How to use the Remaining Leeway for Expansionary Fiscal Policies Within the Current EU Fiscal Framework
Abstract:  Fiscal policy in the Euro area has been dominated by austerity measures implemented under the institutional setting of the 'reformed' stability and growth pact, and the even stricter 'fiscal compact' for some years. Since mid-2014 calls for a more expansionary fiscal policy to overcome the economic crisis have become more frequent.  The EU-Commission in this spirit has launched the Juncker-Plan to stimulate (public) investment and is using a less strict interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact in order to provide more fiscal leeway for countries under unfavourable economic circumstances. This paper argues that these steps do not go far enough and that indeed a truly expansionary fiscal policy in the dimension of two to three per cent of Euro area GDP for a few years is possible even within the existing institutional framework. Special emphasis is put on the method of cyclical adjustment employed by the European Commission in order to assess member states’ fiscal position and effort as well as on ways to increase public investment. It is demonstrated that even in the existing framework the leeway for a macroeconomically and socially more sensible fiscal policy using the interpretational leeway inherent in the rules could be quite substantial.

Title:  What Do We (and Others) Mean by “The Terms of Trade”?
Abstract:  I explore how the concept of “the terms of trade” has been used since Alfred Marshall coined it. Early writers (Taussig, Viner, Dorrance) constructed variations on the relative price of traded goods that Marshall was concerned with, but most of these variations have been left behind in modern uses of the term, which today almost always refer to a relative price of exports and imports. However, when authors have wanted to identify the terms of trade with a particular country and to represent it either symbolically in an economic model or empirically, they have had to choose between defining the terms of trade as the relative price of exports or the relative price of imports. The first to do this was Taussig, who chose the second option, but he was followed by Viner who chose the first, and Viner was followed in this choice by almost all writers for the next several decades. Then, around 1980, Taussig’s choice came back into fashion among scholars of international finance. I document this contrast in definitions between international trade and international finance, then add slightly to Viner’s argument for preferring that the terms of trade of a country be defined as the relative price of its exports.

Title:  Analysing the Effect of Remittances on Rural Household in Pakistan
Abstract:  Rural households are more vulnerable to uncertain situations, for these uncertainty they diversify not only their resources but their income. Income receive to households is in three formats i.e. labour income, internal remittance income and external remittance income. Rural households invest for uncertain situation in future, rural households invest in assets in good time and this investment help them to tackle future uncertainty. Current paper investigates by using the data of PSLM that how remittances effect accumulation of assets, because remittances are utilise as transitory income. Results also explains that external remittances significantly affect the assets accumulation of rural households.

Title:  Mathematical Analysis of Historical Income Per Capita Distributions
Abstract:  Data describing historical growth of income per capita [Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP/cap)] for the world economic growth and for the growth in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, former USSR, Africa and Latin America are analysed. They follow closely the linearly-modulated hyperbolic distributions represented by the ratios of hyperbolic distributions obtained by fitting the GDP and population data. Results of this analysis demonstrate that income per capita was increasing monotonically. There was no stagnation and there were no transitions from stagnation to growth. The usually postulated dramatic escapes from the Malthusian trap never happened because there was no trap in the economic growth. Unified Growth Theory is fundamentally incorrect because its central postulates are contradicted repeatedly by data, which were used but never analysed during the formulation of this theory. The large body of readily-available data opens new avenues for the economic and demographic research. They show that certain fundamental postulates revolving around the concept of Malthusian stagnation need to be replaced by the evidence-based interpretations. Within the range of analysable data, which for the growth of population extends down to 10,000 BC, growth of human population and economic growth were hyperbolic. There was no Malthusian stagnation and there were no transitions to distinctly faster trajectories. Industrial Revolution had no impact on changing growth trajectories.

Title:  Social Obstacles to Technology, Technological Change, and the Economic Growth of African Countries: Some Anecdotal Evidence from Economic History
Abstract:  This paper comments on a number of social obstacles to the economic growth and technological change of African economies from the perspective of economic history. Economic history is full of evidence about what held African economies back for years. Some obstacles are of domestic origin such as excessive consumption and luxury masqueraded as public investment. Other obstacles were imposed from outside such as the destruction and weakening of traditional African religions and religious leadership as well as other wide ranging institutions. The combined effects can be summed up in one word: de-institutionalization. De-institutionalization devalued local knowledge (technology) thereby reducing performance. It is not possible to turn the clock back, but current policy is better-off bringing these obstacles into discussion as they stand a good chance of lowering the socalled “Africa dummy” variable common to growth regressions. Future research would also benefit if it sought to adjust conventional economic theory to allow space for the special features of African economies. Market theory is misleading in treating private use rights as antithetical to private ownership rights. For example, the suggestion that land tenure in Africa is anti-growth is inconsistent with the spectacular growth China has experienced even without private property rights.

Title:  Should We Cut on the Executive in Order to Save the Constitutional State?
Abstract:  Constitutional states, as a separate category of social structures, are progressively losing their economic power, as measured with their capacity to appropriate the available capital stock. Fiscal policies, and the corresponding institutions of public finance, play a significant role in the public appropriation of capital, both through direct redistribution and indirect incentives to private allocation. Policies evolve into institutions after experimentation, yet, as a species, we are not really good at experimenting with our own social structures. The case of New Zealand and their public reforms shows an interesting path, possibly to follow, so as to increase the capacity of experimenting with fiscal policies – and to devise more efficient institutions - through enhanced fiscal prerogatives of the legislative in comparison to the executive.

Title:  Smalholders’ Market Inclusion through Improved Eco-management – The Case of Bulgaria
Abstract:  Enhancing environmental performance is a prospective way for increasing market inclusion, effectiveness and sustainability of small-scale farms around the globe. With a very few exceptions, there are no studies on forms, factors and efficiency of “eco-driven” market inclusion of smallholders in modern supply chains in Bulgaria. This paper presents findings of a first large-scale study on state, driving forces, and efficiency of market inclusion of farms through enhanced eco-management in Bulgaria. First, diverse forms of eco-management in farms with different size, market orientation, product specialization, and location are identified. Second, costs, effects, and efficiency of eco-management are assessed, including the extent the improve eco-performance contributes to increased market inclusion of farms. Third, critical personal, economic, contractual, institutional, etc. factors of managerial choice in the eco-active farms are specified. Forth, perspectives of expansion of this particular mode of market inclusion of Bulgarian smallholdes are estimated. Finaly, directions for improving public policies and business strategies of smallholders in Bulgaria and other countries with similar conditions are suggested..

Title:  Keynesian Spiritus Animales Approach and the Transformation of the Capitalist System
Abstract:  Economic crises have radical consequences. They are major challenges for national and international social policy. The crises are also the cause of reform and of re-definition of theories. The Keynesian approach also emerged from an economic crisis and it has reformed the capitalist system. However, the Keynesian theory itself now needs to be reformed. This paper aims to bring light into the Keynesian theory and the transformation process of capital system. Finally, as lessons for the future two conclusions arise: Firstly, policy makers shall continue to have the assumption that economic crises do not have a simple and permanent solution, which is valid at any time. Secondly, it needs not only traditional economic policies, but especially institutional reforms and new innovative perspectives. In this respect, the Keynesian definition “animal spirit of capitalism” can be useful in predicting the next policy of the liberal economy in the age of globalism.

Title:  Paul Davidson, Post Keynesian Theory and Policy: A Realistic Analysis of the Market Oriented Capitalist Economy
Abstract:  In this book Davidson develops Post Keynesian strategies for full employment policies, targeting inflation and offers solutions for the problems of globalization. Davidson´s message is clear: Markets cannot regulate by itself. Mainstream theories are all based on wrong assumptions like the neutrality of money, the predictability of the future (ergodic-axiom), the efficiency of markets, rational expectations, Say´s Law and Walrasian Theory of equilibriums. In this book Davidson rejects all these assumptions and therefore offers Post-Keynesian solutions. From the viewpoint of Davidson these misleading assumptions of mainstream theories lead to a wrong economic policy resulting in high unemployment rates. He also criticizes Samuelson´s neoclassical synthesis embedded in a Neo-Walrasian model, which Keynes clearly rejected. In an article (Neglected Prophets) written by Holt, Rosser, Wray (1998), Davidson is described as an economist who would have lost the discussion in the short run, but will win it in the long run (Holt et al., 1998:505). That sounds promising, but Davidson would not agree to this conclusion in the sense he would be a prophet. For a prophet the future is already pre-determined by the past, but in a non-ergodic world the future is open and not pre-determined. The future remains to be as not predictable.

Abstract:  The recent rise in Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) across the globe can be explained by the growing depth of intra-regional international production networks (IPNs) connecting firms across borders, slow progress of WTO negotiations under the Doha Round, among others. The upcoming RTAs, through granting of preferential tariff to partnersand introduction of trade facilitation measures including mutual recognition of standards and customs cooperation agreements, promote trade both in intermediate and final products. Intra-regional trade is increasingly taking place through multi-modal forms of transport, and ensuring seamless connectivity successfully complements the trade policy reforms.

Title:  Effectiveness of State Aid for Investments In The Process of Economic Growth: Turkish Case
Abstract:  Economic growth concept has important place in the field of economics since it is started to studied as a social science. Particularly after economic and social destruction has been deeply perceived during the Great War, by the sides who were centered and most suffered, and then in the postwar period in 1929 when global economic crisis peaked. Therefore, in the upcoming years the governments had developed new economic policies in order to solve the increasing economical problems. They support various policies in order to ensure sustainable economic growth and development to individuals and legal entities by providing, sometimes redistributing, public funds. Usually, those funds are tax and insurance premium payments relieves, transfer expenditures, trade and agricultural subsidies, and investment supports. This research investigates effectiveness of the governments aids on economic growth, specifically by focusing investment supports, and to determine what direction and rate it takes under growth theories. In this research, the gross added value is dependent, and economical and social ones are selected as independent variables. And then they are included to the model, which focuses on Turkey by classifying regions as developed and less developed. The model uses panel data analysis. The findings are supports that, in Turkey include both developed and less developed regions, Department of Economics’ subsidized investment documents and fixed investment subsidies have positive effect on the gross added value.

Title:  Eight Strategies for Development in Comparison
Abstract:  The article provides a broad-based overview on competing development strategies and the economic performance of developing countries, mainly since the year 2000. Four traditional mainstream development strategies are discussed (Washington Consensus, neo-liberalism, “good governance” and MDGs) and three long-debated key strategic issues are reconsidered (inward or outward development with export-led growth, industrialisation or growth with predominant primary goods exports, foreign-aid-based development). A heterodox approach to development with a focus on macroeconomic policies and structural change is added and discussed in more detail. Implicitly, this lays the groundwork for a macroeconomic theory of development. The rough empirical comparison finds that countries and areas with strong emphasis on macroeconomic policies, mainly in Asia, have performed unambiguously better than the mainstream approaches since 1980. From successful Asian countries, it can be learnt that a long-run continuous growth and development performance with more resilience against adverse shocks is key. Almost all larger middle-income countries have embarked on industrialisation; strategies based upon primary commodities or high current account deficits are unlikely to be successful in the long run. A stronger role of a package of six macroeconomic policies is advised, particularly for the larger economies. Size matters in this respect. Smaller countries depend stronger on market niches and idiosyncratic strategies. The global economic order, due to liberalisation of trade and finance, including the prevailing global currency system, sets harsh constraints for policy space towards implementing national strategies.

Title:  A Literature Review of the Efficient Market Hypothesis
Abstract:  The efficient market hypothesis and behavioural finance theory have been the cornerstone of modern asset pricing for the past 50 odd years. Although both theories are fundamental in explaining modern asset pricing, they are opposing views. The efficient market hypothesis dictates that the price of any asset depends on the information, while the behavioural finance theory dictates that the price depends on the reaction of the market participants to the information. Therein lays the key to the argument influencing modern asset pricing, does price immediately reflect the information or market participants’ perception of the information. In this paper, we will critical evaluate the theory influencing the efficient market hypothesis. We will review the neoclassical economics underpinning the efficient market hypothesis and the recent empirical evidence. In concluding, we find that although the efficient market hypothesis has difficulties in testing and the empirical evidence is mixed. Yet it is useful as a benchmark for regulators and central bankers alike. However, market participants are homo sapiens and not homo economics; hence there is a requirement to understand their reaction. So in essence leading to a requirement to include the behavioural finance theory, if we are to understand asset pricing.

Title:  How Islamic is the Diminishing Musharkah Model used for Home Financing?
Abstract:  For financing consumer durables like houses, cars or computers, conventional banks use what are called the equated monthly installment (EMI) models. EMI is the fixed payment a borrower makes to a lender to pay off both interest and principal each month so that over a specified number of years, the loan amount is cleared in full. Islamic banks have followed the practice using EMI on diminishing musharakah partnership basis. The model is popularly known as the MMP, an abbreviation of its Arabic nomenclature. The defining character of this model is increasing amortization of capital through a customer buy back provision in the agreement. We have shown more than once that models of the sort invariably involve compounding of return on capital and pass the ownership of property to the client at a slower rate than the rate of capital amortization until the contract is concluded.  This paper provides additional evidence and documentation to reiterate that the MMP exhibits the same characteristics and is not, therefore, Shari’ah compliant. We propose an alternative model free of the indicated blemishes, having additional advantages as well.

Title:  Impact of Brand Dynamics on Insurance Premiums in Turkey
Abstract:  This paper examines influences of brand dynamics on insurance premium productions in Turkey using a dynamic GMM panel estimation technique sampling 31 insurance firms over 2005-2015. The results reveals that brands trust appears as a chief driving force behind premium production where its unit increase augments premium outputs by 5.32 million Turkish Liras (TL). Moreover, the brand value of firms also appears a statistically significant determinant of premium sales, but its size impact remains limited comparing to brand trust, i.e. a million TL increase in brand value generates only 0.02 million TL increase in sales. On the other hand, the study also documents a strong momentum driven from past years premium production with trade-off magnitude of 1 to 0.85. This might imply a higher loyalty-stickiness of customers in Turkey, as well as a self-feeding "bandwagon effect".

Title:  BA Note on Construction of a Composite Index by Optimization of Shapley Value Shares of the Constituent Variables
Abstract:  This paper proposes a method to construct composite index, which is a linear combination of several variables, by deriving weights on the criterion of Shapley value (from cooperative game theory) that a constituent variable has in making the composite index.  In practice it is found oftentimes that the most common method of principal component analysis has a tendency to ignore (or poorly weigh) those constituent variables that do not have strong correlation with the sister variables. This elitist nature of PCA forces a compromise upon the analyst’s desire and need to incorporate those weakly correlated (but theoretically and practically important) variables into the composite index. In that case, one must construct a composite index that is more inclusive in nature. The Shapley value based composite index meets that requirement.

Title:  A New Era of Monetary Policymaking in the Light of the Post-Crisis Challenges
Abstract:  Within appearing the global financial crisis, standard macroeconomic approaches, in particular, monetary policies conducted prior to global recession have become targets of harsh criticism because of their weakness against these imbalances. The recession was a consequence of multiple factors including excessive private and public debt, poor financial surveillance and incapability of institutional structure to cope with potential risk sources. However, due to the nature of the recession, monetary authorities have been accused much more because of uncertainties relating to their mandates, weakness of their precautionary signaling and also time-inconsistency problems of policy transmission channels.In addition, because of limited effects of both conventional and unconventional measures, the urgent need to revise mandates of monetary authorities and totally the nature of monetary policy is the topic attracting significant attention. In this context, reassessment of cardinalshifting in monetary policies and implementation of fundamental realignments to the conventional central banking conception can be noted as challenges of post-crisis period.

Title:  Zakah Management for Poverty Alleviation in Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam
Abstract:  Concern for poverty is not new and has been the focus for centuries by historians, sociologists and economists. The cause has been identified, ranging from shortcomings in the administration of income support, until the injustice of the social and economic system. Various attempts have been proposed, from the reform of social security system for changes in the form of the socio-economic system. Because poverty is a multidimensional problem, solutions to poverty require a set of coordinated action, particularly through charity. Indonesia, which has a population with a large population, of course, the problem of poverty continues to be a problem in economic development. Nevertheless, the potential zakat Indonesia larger community and cooperation among stakeholders and government regulation is a solution to reduce the level of poverty in Indonesia. It is certainly different from the Brunei Darussalam to the level of a small population and large government revenues, management of zakat by MUIB in the form of cash grants, the capital of commerce, and others are implementable can solve the problem of poverty in this country.

Title:  FDI in R&D in India: An Introspection
Abstract:  Of late, India has emerged as an attractive destination of foreign direct investment (FDI).  Along with it, multinationals have been investing significantly in research and development in India. In this context, this paper makes an attempt to analyze salient features of FDI in R&D and makes an assessment of the gains from R&D initiatives of MNCs in India. To be specific, the paper attempts to demystify the FDI flows in R&D with a view to understand whether these types of flows would help in raising the innovation potential of India. We find that there has been a rise FDI in R&D in India. However, the rise has not been commensurate only with rise in Core R&D activities. Rather, more than 50% of the inflows in R&D by MNCs have come for non-core R&D activities. This will not help in promoting innovation culture in India and make India a global manufacturing hub.

Title:  The Europranization of national Foreign Policies: The Examples og germany and France within the Framework of Ukraine Crisis
Abstract:  This study aims to investigate the effects of foreign policy cooperation processes laid down at European Union (EU) level on national foreign policies. Vast majority of the current literature on European integration focus on the impacts of developments at EU level, supra-national institutionalization and policy-making processes on member states. However, as the domain of foreign policy, which has been included within the institutional framework of the EU with the Maastricht Treaty, is under the control of member states, it has been excluded from these investigations for a long time. Even though the foreign policy of EU has an intergovernmental character, the expansion of the foreign policy domain and the development of institutional structures after the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty have introduced considerable changes in the national foreign policies of member states. In this context, the main problematic of this study is to examine how and in what ways EU foreign policy, which was designed to be under the control of member states as a result of concerns related with sovereignty, unveil the changes in member states’ foreign policies. Providing an explanation for this problematic has become significant as national foreign policies have increasingly become the subject matter of foreign policy-making at EU level after the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty. In order to account for this problematic, the concept of Europeanization, which examines the effects of the EU integration processes and developments on member states and suggests a different approach to the European integration, was employed. Moreover, this study addressed the Ukraine crisis, which posed a considerable threat to European peace and stability in the post-Cold War era, as a case study. The changes in the national foreign policies of two prominent members of the European Union, Germany and France, towards Russia within the course of Ukraine crisis were also examined in the context of the Europeanization concept. Consequently, it is seen that constant participation of member states in the foreign policy-making processes at EU level initiates significant changes in member states’ national foreign policies, even though it cannot cause a transformation of national foreign policies. While such change assists the growth of institutional structures at EU level, it also enables more binding decisions to be made for the Europeanization of member states’ national foreign policies. Thereby, national foreign policies of member states become more likely to be influenced by the foreign policy at EU level.

Title:  Factors Influencing Female Labor Force Participation in Egypt and Germany: A Comparative Study
Abstract:  This paper aims to identify the major factors influencing female labor force participation (FLFP) in Egypt and Germany. On a narrow scope and given the unclear relationship between educational attainment and Egyptian FLFP, this paper seeks to examine the effect of educational attainment on the Egyptian FLFP while considering other personal and household factors. On a broader scope, the literature on FLFP illustrates that certain personal and household characteristics determine FLFP. However, the question remains, to what extent these determinants differ between Egypt and Germany. This paper attempts to shed light on understanding if and how specific demographic factors affect the Egyptian FLFP in comparison with the German FLFP. Limited dependent variable technique; Probit model is utilized to determine which factors influence FLFP in both countries. The cross sectional analysis is conducted through the use of the 2012 Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) in collaboration with Egypt’s Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) and the 2012 German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Findings indicate that indeed higher educational attainment increases the Egyptian female’s predicted probability of participating in the labor market. Additionally, the comparative study showed that number of factors affect FLFP in both countries, some of which has a positive influence as years of schooling and age while others with a negative impact as being a married women, living in urban areas and number of children. On the other hand some other variables impact each country differently as wealth. Additionally, it was evident that years of schooling has a higher marginal impact on Egyptian FLFP yet, age, being married and number of children have a higher marginal effect on German FLFP.

Title:  The Distributions in Nature and Entropy Principle
Abstract:  The derivation of the maximum entropy distribution of particles in boxes yields two kinds of distributions: a "bell-like" distribution and a long-tail distribution. The first one is obtained when the ratio between particles and boxes is low, and the second one - when the ratio is high. The obtained long tail distribution yields correctly the empirical Zipf law, Pareto's 20:80 rule and Benford's law. Therefore, it is concluded that the long tail and the "bell-like" distributions are outcomes of the tendency of statistical systems to maximize entropy.

Title:  Mathematical Analysis of Income Per Capita in the United Kingdom
Abstract:  Industrial Revolution did not boost economic growth and the growth of population even in the United Kingdom, the centre of this revolution. On the contrary, from around 1850, economic growth and the growth of population started to be diverted to slower trajectories. The new trend describing the growth of income per capita (Gross Domestic Product per capita, i.e. GDP/cap) is now analysed using Maddison’s data. Two numerical solutions and two analytical solutions of the differential equation describing the growth rate of income per capita are presented.  It is demonstrated yet again that even strong fluctuations in the growth rate do not change the shape of growth trajectories. Thus, contrary to the common misconception, even strong fluctuations in the growth rate cannot be used as the evidence of the existence of Malthusian stagnation because they do not change the mechanism of growth. Such strong fluctuations can at best produce only small and negligible ripples in growth trajectories. Our analysis shows also that the current growth of income per capita in the UK follows an unsustainable trajectory.

Title:  A Multifaceted Panel Data Gravity Model Analysis of Peru’s Foreign Trade
Abstract:  Peru’s abundant natural resources and friendly trade policies have made the country a major economic player in both South America and the global community. Consequently, exports are playing an increasingly important role in Peru’s national economy. Indeed, growing from 13.1% as of 1994, exports now contribute approximately 21% of the GDP of Peru as of 2015.Given Peru’s growing global influence, the time is ripe for a thorough analysis of the most important factors governing its export performance. Thus, within the framework of the augmented gravity model of trade, this paper examines Peru’s export performance and attempts to identify the dominant economic factors that should be further developed to increase the value of exports. The analysis was conducted from three different aspects: (1) general economic parameters’ effect on Peru’s export value, (2) more specific analysis into a major specific trade good, copper, and (3) the impact that regional trade agreements have had on Peru’s export performance. Our panel data analysis results for each dataset revealed interesting economic trends and were consistent with the theoretical expectations of the gravity model: namely positive coefficients for economic size and negative coefficients for distance. This report’s results can be a reference for the proper direction of Peruvian economic policy so as to enhance economic growth in a sustainable direction.

Title:  Investment and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis for Tanzania
Abstract:  This paper analyzes the causal effect between domestic private investment, public investment, foreign direct investment and economic growth in Tanzania during the 1970-2014 period. The modified neo-classical growth model is used to estimate the effect of investment on economic growth. Also, the economic growth models based on Phetsavong & Ichihashi (2012), and Le & Suruga (2005) are used to estimate the crowding out effect of public investment on domestic private investment on one hand and foreign direct investment on the other hand. In the same way, the crowding out effect of foreign direct investment on domestic private investment is estimated. A correlation test is applied to check the correlation among independent variables, and the results show that there is very low correlation suggesting that multicollinearity is not a serious problem. Moreover, the diagnostic tests including RESET regression errors specification test, Breusch-Godfrey serial correlation LM test, Jacque-Bera-normality test and white heteroskedasticity test reveal that the model has no signs of misspecification and that, the residuals are serially uncorrelated, normally distributed and homoskedastic. Broadly, the empirical results show that the domestic private investment and foreign direct investment play an important role in economic growth in Tanzania. Besides, a revealed negative, albeit weak, association between public and private investment suggests that the positive effect of domestic private investment on economic growth becomes smaller when public investment-to-GDP ratio exceeds 8-10 percent. Similarly, foreign direct investment tends to marginally reduce the impact of domestic private investment on growth. These results suggest that public investment and foreign direct investment need to be considered carefully in order to avoid a reduced positive impact of domestic private investment on growth. Domestic saving may be promoted to encourage domestic investment for economic growth.

Title:  Turning Human Waste into Renewable Energy: Opportunities and Policy Options for India
Abstract:  With rise in population and the ongoing urbanisation drive, the urge to ensure energy security both for the rural and urban areas has emerged as a major challenge in India. The demand for energy has increased in all spheres of life, e.g., for cooking, cultivation, production purposes, transportation, and so on. Although through various government initiatives, adoption of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking has increased, given the vast population, use of biofuels is expected to continue for poorer households. Generation of biogas from cattle waste in India has intensified through policies, but the same from human waste is still in a nascent stage. The present study explores the possibilities of recovering energy and nutrients from human wasteby discussing the present system of human waste collection, treatment and disposal in India, followed by the reasons behind the failures of the past initiatives (e.g., Ganga Action Plan, GAP). It further focuses on a few alternative systems and their technical feasibility. It is concluded that various ongoing policies, viz., National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), ‘Swachh Bharat Mission’ (SBM)- should be coordinated for integrating collection and treatment of human waste for generation of renewable energy.

Title:  Appropriate Exchange Rate Regime for Economic Structure of Pakistan
Abstract:  This study attempts to find the appropriate exchange rate regime for economic structure of Pakistan. To this end the study uses ARDL bond testing approach to estimate long run and for the estimation of short run analysis Error correction model (ECM) is applied. Time series data is used over the period from 1984 to 2012. Findings reveal that Trade openness, foreign exchange reserves, and inflation rate are important determinant while choosing appropriate exchange-rate regime for economy having features like Pakistan. On the basis of analysis, this study suggests that both extreme ends hard peg and free float are unfavorable for it. The results also survive during robustness check. However, caution is required while making a policy decision as clear-cut answer is absent.  Nonetheless, choice of regime is a difficult task in empirical analysis because few factors cannot explain actual regime.

Title:  Relationship between Tax Regulations and Direct Foreign Capital: Case of Balkan Countries
Abstract:  Balkan countries draw attention of many countries and investors after eastern bloc countries spread to free market economy. Moreover, these countries need to attract foreign capital as a development instrumental in order to adapt to the market system. They, for the purpose of attracting foreign capital inflow to their own countries, utilize tax advantages with many other applications. In this study, the relationship between foreign capital and tax in 11 Balkan Countries is examined. Annual data for the period of 2006-2014 was used in this study. System GMM (Dynamic Panel Data) was preferred as a model in this study. According to the findings through the analyses, a negative relationship is observed between indirect taxes and foreign direct capital investments for the sample countries while a positive relationship is found between total tax obligations, obtained from profit based, and foreign direct capital investments.

Title:  Financial and Econometric Study of the Sustainability and Evaluation of Scenarios of Reforms for the Civil Regime of Moroccan
Abstract:  The decline in the demographic ratio corollary to the maturity of the regime and in particular its generosity raise the question of the medium-and long-term financial sustainability of the civil pension scheme of the Moroccan pension fund. This article studies the financial sustainability of civil regimes and evaluates the options for reforms envisaged by the government mainly parametric reform. In this framework, an actuarial and financial model based on demographic assumptions and macroeconomic parameters is constructed and used to analyze the financial sustainability of the status quo regime and the projected regime and also to test the parametric reform. We also use econometric tests such as non-stationarity, causality and cointegration between technical recipes and technical expenditures to empirically evaluate the sustainability of civil scheme of pensions. This paper concludes that the parametric reform of our civil pay-as-you-go system is unsustainable. It would therefore be in favor of other remedial measures and reform strategies to improve and enhance the financial sustainability of the fund, such as the model based on the addition of a funded pillar, and unification of all funds in a single integrated system.

Title:  The Egyptian Electricity Market: Designing a Prudent Peak Load Pricing System
Abstract:  Electricity prices in Egypt have been set significantly lower than the real economic cost of its production and supply. These subsidies encourage the waste of energy and increase the fluctuation in demand, triggering a huge need of additional power generation capacity in Egypt. This dialectical paper addresses this problem by first theoretically analyzing the Egyptian electricity market and then discussing a possible peak load pricing system. According to the results, especially low income households will shift their demand from the peak period to the off peak period. A properly implemented peak load pricing system could reduce the need for power capacity expansion by significant 2000-3000 MW, accompanied by additional savings in the network transmission capacity.

Title:  Access to Finance in Turkey
Abstract:  Access to finance is essential for a successful development and growth of the private sector. In the absence of finance, enterprises cannot develop, innovate, and compete with other firms in other countries which offer more favorable access to finance. This paper makes use of the Enterprise Survey conducted with a representative stratified random sample of 6,006 Turkish firms for the 2015 fiscal year to evaluate the access to finance conditions in the nation. Moreover, data from the Enterprise Surveys Database for a comparison group of countries and 2013 survey for Turkey are employed to put the current survey in perspective.

Title:  The Effect of Corruption on Foreign Direct Investment: A Panel Data Study
Abstract:  Foreign direct investment (FDI) has become an important factor of development in low income countries. At the same time, corruption continues to be one of the greatest obstacles to economic and social development in these countries. However, in East Africa, the study of the nature of corruption as well as its relationship with FDI is scanty in socio-economic literature. In addition, the existing literature provides controversial results. Motivated by these issues, this paper examines the effects of corruption on FDI inflows by incorporating an econometric method based on panel data from 5 East African countries over the 1996-2015 period. The paper contributes to the existing literature by modeling the relationship between corruption and FDI inflows using two measures of corruption, namely corruption perception index (CPI) and control of corruption (CC). Equally important, both economic factors such as GDP per capita, GDP growth, inflation and degree of openness, and quality of institutions or governance indicators such as voice and accountability, political stability and absence of violence, government effectiveness and rule of law are considered in the analysis. Data were obtained from Transparency International, World Bank Development Indicators, Worldwide Governance Indicators and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Analytically the paper uses fixed effects (FE) as the preferable model. The results show that the corruption level in the host country has an adverse effect on FDI inflows when eliminating GDP per capita in the regression. Nonetheless, the results show that the GDP per capita as a proxy for market size and country’s quality of institutions are more important than the level of corruption in encouraging FDI inflows into the country. The key implication of these results is that improvement in the quality of institutions and control of corruption may be an important strategy for increase FDI inflows. The key implication of these results is that an increase in the real GDP per capita, improvement in the quality of institutions as well as control of corruption may be an important strategy for increase FDI inflows.

Title:  How Government Policy and Demographics affect Money Demand Function in Bangladesh
Abstract:  Money demand has a key position in macroeconomics generally and monetary economics particularly. The improved economic condition of any country is a sign of increasing money demand and deteriorating economic climate is a sign of decreasing money demand (Maravic & Palic, 2005). In this study, Autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach of co-integration developed by Pesaran et al., (2001) is used to estimate the money demand function. Real interest rate, GDP per capita, exchange rate, fiscal deficit, urban and rural population are selected to determine money demand function in Bangladesh over the period from 1975-2013. The co-integration analysis reveals that interest rate and per capita GDP exerts significant effect upon money demand both in long run and short run as well. Both urban and rural population have significant effect on money demand in the long run and short run and money demand function is found stable over time.

Therefore, in this paper we investigated the presence of the J-curve between Bosnia and Herzegovina and seven leading trading partners in Southeast Europe. In the study we have used time series of disaggregated data from 1999 to 2015 and econometric techniques such as co-integration analysis, vector error correction, Johansen's co-integration test, diagnostic tests and tests of stability. The results have shown that there is a co-integration and the presence of the phenomenon of J-curve in the case of Romania and Bulgaria, while this effect is absent in other countries.

Title:  Free Trade and FDI in Kosovo: Prospects for Integration into the EU and Turkish Production Networks
Abstract:  Kosovo has recently signed two major trade agreements, the SAA with the EU, andan FTA with Turkey. However, as the experience from developing countries shows, trade liberalisation is a precondition, but it does not ensure economic growth and prosperity, especially when the supply-side constraints limit country’s ability to reap the benefits of free trade. Violencein the nineties; years of underperforming post-war institutions; the neglect of policy reforms, especially poorly managed privatisation process; reduced greatly Kosovo’s industrial base and its manufacturing capacities. Moreover, these factors, coupled with problems with the rule of law, produced a high-risk environment that is deterring the inflow of foreign capital. Following the signing of the two agreements, one can expect that Kosovo will become more attractive tothe European and Turkish investors. In addition to other benefits, the flow of foreign capital may enable Kosovo’s industries to integrate intothe global value chains. However, as with free trade, the impact of FDI inflow and the integration into global value chains depend largely on domestic market conditions. This paper provides a discussion on the developments regarding trade liberalisation and FDI, and the opportunities the latter create on the integration of Kosovo’s industries into global production networks. In terms of policy directions, the paper argues that, although the trade liberalisation will act as a pull factor, the existingstructural impediments in Kosovo will mostlikely limit the flow of foreign capital and the impact of the existing FDI in Kosovo, specifically, integration into global value chains.

Title:  Corruption Forms and Heath Care Provision in Douala Metropolis Public Hospitals of Cameroon
Abstract:  This study analyzes and highlights the most practised forms of corruption in public hospitals of Douala metropolis in Cameroon, namely corruption with theft and that without theft. The results of our analyzes show a predominance of the form without theft, this regardless of the hospital, and this allowed us to classify hospitals based on the dominant form. It appears that the General and Deido Hospitals are health facilities where corruption without theft is the least and the most practiced respectively, while the Cité des Palmiers and New Bell hospitals are those where corruption with theft is the least and the most practiced. An estimate through odds ratios revealed for instance that the odds would be about 5.46 times higher that the form without theft is not practiced at the General hospital compared to other hospitals, and about 11.11 times that it is practiced at Deido hospital compared  to all hospitals.

Title:  The Impact of Economic Growth and Foreign Direct Investment on CO2 Emissions: The Case of Turkey
Abstract:  The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, economic growth, foreign direct investment and energy consumption in Turkey. To this extent, ARDL bounds testing method to cointegration is being implemented over the period of 1970-2014.  The long run estimation results suggest that economic growth and energy consumption have positive impacts on CO2 emissions. However, this research did not find anysignificant relationship between foreign direct investment and CO2 emissions. As a result of these findings, this research reveals some important policy recommendations.

Title:  The Effectiveness Analysis of Public Education and Health Expenditures
Abstract:  This study examines the links between public education and health expenditures, and education and health outcomes- measured by the school life expactancy and rate of child (under five) mortality, life expactancy at birth. It also investigates the role of governance on the effectiveness of public education and health expenditures. The effectiveness of public education and health expenditures is examined within education and health production function by using 2002- 2012 data. Empirical results show that effects of socioeconomic and environmental factors and demographic structure on education and health outcomes are similar to those in previous studies. The results indicate two important findings. First, public education and health expenditures remain incapable to explain outcomes when compared to other socioeconomic variables. Second, increase in public education and health expenditures is associated with improved outcomes just in countries where regulatory quality and control of corruption is high. With a general expression, public education and health expenditures become more effective in countries with high governance level.

Title:  An Econometric Analysis of Demand for Money and its Stability in Tanzania
Abstract:  This paper examines the determinants of demand for money and its stability in Tanzania using annual time series data spanning from 1966 to 2015.  Economic analysis of the money demand function is facilitated by the Johansen cointegration, vector autoregressive-vector error correction model (VAR-VECM) and variance decomposition with the main objective of analyzing the factors which, in both short run and long run, influence its movements. The study is thought to be significant because the demand for real money balances serves as the core link between the monetary policy and the real sector of the economy. Based on the annual data under the period of study, cointegration results reveal that there is a long-run relationship between real money balances and the explanatory variables namely, real GDP, deposit interest rate, real exchange rate and inflation rate. Consistent with money demand theory, the VECM results show that the demand for real money balances is positively related with scale variable (real GDP) but it responds inversely to opportunity cost of holding money (deposit interest rate and inflation rate). Moreover, results provide evidence that the demand for real money balances and real exchange rate are positively associated. Furthermore, after incorporating the stability tests, the empirical results show that real money demand function is stable over the 1966-2015 period, suggesting that it is possible to use the narrow money aggregate as target of monetary policy in Tanzania.

Title:  The Response of Industrial Production to the Price of Oil: New Evidence for Thailand
Abstract:  This paper examines the oil price-industrial production nexus in Thailand by using multivariate cointegration test. In addition, Granger causality is also used to examine the impact of oil price uncertainty on industrial production growth. The main focus of this paper is on one sector of the economy, i.e., manufacturing sector. Monthly data from 1993 to 2015 are utilized. Empirical results reveal that there is a long-run relationship between industrial production and real oil price and other variables. Industrial production adjusts rapidly to shocks to lending rate, price level and oil price. Furthermore, there exists long-run causality running from lending rate, price level and oil price to industrial production. However, industrial production growth does not respond to oil price shock and oil price uncertainty. Asymmetric and nonlinear relationship between oil price shock and industrial output growth is not found. These findings give some policy implications.

Title:  The Development and Application of Transaction Cost Economics in Taiwan
Abstract:  This study collected 89 papers related to transaction cost theory published between 1992 and 2013 from 19 journals in the Taiwan Social Sciences Citation Index database, and used bibliometrics and network analysis to examine the theory’s applications and development. The results show that the theory has mostly been applied in studies on technology management, transaction information, stocks/foreign exchange/investment, business transfers, strategies, opportunistic behaviors, performance, theoretical integration, human resources, relations, knowledge management, and consumer behaviors. Of these topics, strategies had the most samples; followed by stocks/foreign exchange/investment, which accounted for 19.10% of the total; followed by relations, with 17.98%; and technology management, with 11.24%. The greatest numbers of publications were observed in 1997 and 2007. Connections between the authors appeared to be weak and cross-referencing was rare. Apparently, more time is required for the formation of a research community with strong coherence and knowledge integration capabilities.

Title:  The Effect of the Period that Turkey is going Through on the Household Expenditures of Burdur Province: Engel Curve Analysis
Abstract:  Consumers need a variety of goods and services in order to maintain their lives. The consumption patterns of consumers can vary depending on the differences in geographical and socio-economic structure, the time period during which the analysis takes place and the specific circumstances that the country is going through. For this reason, the relationship between income and expenditure has been subject to many studies till today. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of the geographical diversity and the special situation that Turkey is going through on the household consumption patterns of the Burdur province. In this study, income & expenditure relations of twelve expenditure groups and their position in total expenditures and income elasticity of these expenditure groups shall be estimated with the help of Engel functions by using the data obtained from questionnaires implemented on randomly selected 695 households residing in Center County of Burdur Province between the dates January 03, 2017 and February 28, 2017.As a result of the analysis, it has been found that food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcohol and tobacco products, housing expenses, health services, communication and clothing and foot-wear expenditure groups are in the obligatory class of goods; furniture, home appliances and home care services, culture and entertainment, educational expenses, and restaurant and hotel expenses are in luxury goods class. Therefore, it has been reached to conclusion that the period that Turkey is going through does not have any effect on the household income-consumption pattern of Burdur province.

Title:  Assessment of Climate Change on Sesame Cultivation in Makurdi Local Government Area of Benue State, Nigeria
Abstract:  The study was conducted to determine the assessment of climate change and ascertain the awareness among sesame farmers in Makurdi local government area of Benue state. A sample of 120 farmers participated in the study. Descriptive statistics and logit regression were used to analyse the data. The results shows that more male farmers (69.2%) within the age range of 21-40 years are involved in the production of sesame when compared to female farmers (30.8%). It was observed that most of the farmers are married (82.5%). The educational level is low among sesame farmers with most of them having only primary education (45%). The result also shows that most of the farmers have farming experience of less than 10years with a farm size of less than 4 hectares. Insect infestation, soil erosion is perceived as reasons for low yield. Sesame farmers have adapted to such changes through the use of improved seed varieties, use of chemicals and mixed cropping. Results also showed that extension agents, educated farmers and relatives were the major sources of information about climate change. It was also revealed that climate has little effect on sesame as the average yield of the crop is 57.5% compared to low yield of 13.3%, also socio-economic characteristics of the farmers do not have any significant effect on the awareness of climate change as only household size and age are statistically significant at 1% and 5% respectively. To improve farmers’ awareness on climate change, the study recommends that there should be improvement in newspaper and radio/television broadcast in other to sustain sesame production in the event of climate change.

This studyalso examines  the semi-strong form  of  the  EMH of DSE based  on  macroeconomic  variable  version  of  the  Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) applying Cointegration tests, Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) and Granger causality tests,  and  the volatility of the DSE returns in response  to  the  volatility of the  macroeconomic variables employing GARCH family models using monthly data from January 2001 to December 2012.In addition, the short run and long run relationships between macroeconomic variables and aggregate stock prices in Bangladesh have also been determined. Employing both nonparametric tests (Runs test and Phillips-Perron test) and parametric tests (Autocorrelation test and Augmented Dickey-fuller test), this study finds that the DSE of Bangladesh is not weak form efficient. Taking the outcome of VAR models into account, it is found that all selected macroeconomic variables do significantly explain the stock prices of the Bangladesh stock market. As a consequence, it may be concluded that the Bangladesh stock market is not efficient in the semi-strong form of EMH. Results of the estimated MA(1)-GARCH(1,1) and MA(1)-EGARCH(1,1) models reveal that stock market returns of Bangladesh exhibit leptokurtosis, volatility clustering and leverage effect. Results of six GARCH-S models indicate that thevolatility of DSE return is significantly influenced by the volatility of macroeconomic variables, such as, exchange rate, broad money supplyandstock returns of India.

Title:  Understanding the sources of high current account fluctuations in 5 developed economies
Abstract:  The global economy has, in recent times, continued to face large and unprecedented external imbalances. Despite reductions recorded in aggregate current account (saving less investment) to global output ratio, the imbalances still remain. The main contributors to the imbalances have been the world’s developed economies. These developed economies have experienced fluctuating current account balances over the years and the fluctuation has contributed to a slow correction of the imbalances. This paper identifies 5 developed economies with the highest fluctuations in current account balances and analyses the sources of these fluctuations. The countries are Singapore, Latvia, Iceland, Norway and Estonia. Results obtained suggest that 1) temporary shocks account for most current account fluctuations, and the excess response to temporary shocks is as stable and pronounced as in previous studies; 2) permanent shocks drive current account fluctuations in Iceland and Latvia but not in Norway, Estonia, and Singapore; 3) Singapore demonstrates the most support for the two-good intertemporal model, since external supply and demand shocks account for its current account fluctuations.

Title:  New alternative measuring financial stability
Abstract:  If the z-score index is widely used as a measure of the stability in conventional banks, it would be more reliable to find an appropriate measure of the stability forall type of banks. Knowing that the cooperative or Islamic banks follow different contracts forms of investments such the PLS system and are closer to real economic, by considering the illiquid assets, we expect that the new measure labelled g-score, associated to real economic growth, reflects multiple risks and allows to track the banking stability.

Title:  Institutional quality and economic growth in East African economies
Abstract:  This study examines the effect of quality of institutions on economic growth in five East African countries using panel data for the period spanning from1996 to 2015. Fixed effects (FE) and random effects (RE) models were employed for estimation. Using Hausman test, FE was earmarked to be more appropriate model for this study. The empirical findings show that the quality of institution significantly impacts on economic growth. Political stability, government effectiveness, rule of law and control of corruption in particular are significant variables. Regulatory quality, voice and accountability indicate insignificant effect on growth. The results suggest that governance that promotes strong institutions is an important condition for economic growth. Particular focus should be focused on enhancing political stability, government effectiveness, rule of law and control of corruption so as to attain economic development.

Title:  Economics case study: Harvard Business School pedagogy techniques: From teaching entrepreneurship to influencing business policy through research
Abstract:  The case study explains the need for social entrepreneurship while remaining in the premise of mainstream economics. A detailed discussion is carried out on the vulnerabilities of economic policy making that has led to some of the new initiatives at Harvard Business School to promote such pedagogy practices at Business Schools that may eventually influence national and international policy making to the benefit of the society and not only the economies of developed and developing countries. Two brief cases are presented.  First one takes evolution of HBS course at a Pakistani university to develop superior pedagogy for student learning towards social entrepreneurship. The other case maps the journey of bilateral relationships between China and Pakistan from Free trade agreement to CPEC as a matter of national policy to evaluate local business risks and potentials.

Title:  What determines the growth of services sector in Pakistan? A comparison of ARDL bound testing and time varying parametric estimation with general to specific approach
Abstract:  This empirical study followed time varying parametric approach (Kalman Filter) and auto regression distributed lag (ARDL) with general to specific approach to find out relevant macroeconomic determinants of Pakistan’s services sector’s growth. To our best of knowledge, no author has made such study that employed these estimation techniques to find out determinants of services sector growth in Pakistan while employing general to specific approach. Current study bridges this gap. Annual data was taken from World Development Indicators (2014) during period 1976-2014. Main findings of the study are that rolling regression estimates of explanatory variables justify the use of Kalman filtering approach. Results show that inflation has negative effect on services sector output growth in case of TVP approach. This result does match with ARDL results.  Net foreign direct investment has positive and significant effect on services sector output growth in both techniques of estimation. Gross national expenditures with positive effect are the relevant significant determinants of services sector output growth at five percent significance level in case of TVP approach while relationship was insignificant in case of ARDL estimation. Impact of remittances received on services sector growth is negative in case of time varying parametric approach. This result is different from ARDL results where relationship is positive and significant at five percent level of significance. All the one step ahead state vectors confirmed the stability of models in case of time varying parametric approach. Cumulative sum of recursive residuals (CUSUM) and cumulative sum of recursive residuals square (CUSUMQ) also confirmed the stability of results of auto regression distributed lag. Based on these empirical findings, we conclude that government should focus on service sector growth augmenting factors while formulating any policy relevant to the concerned sector.

Title:  The influences of cognition of institutional logics and triple helix relations on innovation performance: An empirical study of firms in industrial park in Taiwan
Abstract:  The present study set out to investigate into the influences of cognition of institutional logics and triple helix relationships (i.e., the industry-university-government linkages) on firm innovation performance in the context of Taiwan industrial parks. The data from 131 organizational-level questionnaires collected from firms located in different industrial parks were analyzed. The results showed that cognition of institutional logics is positively associated with firms’ innovation performance. Furthermore, such positive relationship is strengthened by the number of triple helix relationships in the form of mediation but not moderation effect. Theoretical and practical implications were elaborated.

Title:  Democracy: An opportunity or a threat to Iran's economic structure
Abstract:  The main aim of this study is to evaluate the role of democracy in Iran’s economic structure during 1983 to 2012. Iran’s economic structure is divided into two oil and non-oil parts and is investigated in the governments of Seyed Ali Khamenei, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Seyed Mohammad Khatami, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In this context, the government of Mr. Khamenei is selected as the base government and other governments are compared to that. Results of the oil part showed that the government of Mr. Khatami had a better performance in terms of capital, labor and political risk. With regard to oil exports, the two other governments have had the same performance as the base government. Results of the non-oil part showed that the effect of exports on economic growth in the governments of Mr. Hashemi Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad is like the base government; while it is significantly different from the base government in the government of Mr. Khatami. Labor has had a negative effect in Mr. Hashemi Rafsanjani and Ahmadinejad’s governments, while its impact on economic growth is positive in Khatami's government. Political risks had the greatest effect on economic growth in the government of Mr. Ahmadinejad (relative to Mr. Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mr. Khatami’s governments).

Title:  The role of institutional factors when determining investment strategies of sovereign wealth funds in stock market
Abstract:  Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) are investment vehicles of governments which use its assets in hand for the favor of public interest.  SWFs invest a vast amount of money that varies in amount from year to year both in national and international platforms. Funds which provide an excellent source mean a lot for developed countries as much as they mean to developing countries. In this study, the factors SWFs consider while investing in the stock market are analyzed. Panel data is chosen for analysis using SWF and Heritage institutional factor index. New Zeeland is selected as example to illustrate that from which institutional factor, such as private property right, law enforcement, tax responsibility and freedom of labor, influenced investments New Zeeland SWF made in stock markets of 42 different countries.

Title:  Did we find alternate to GDP to measure national progress? Analysis of Harvard University’s social progress index 
Abstract:  For major part of the preceding century, Economic Measures such as GDP, GNI etc were considered to measure economic as well as social and human progress of a country. However, scholars have raised concerns over the sufficiency of these economic measures. This propelled scholars to develop alternate measures for social improvement and human capability development. Consequently, indices such as Social Progress Imperative (SPI) and Human Development Index (HDI) were developed by renowned authors. However, little work is done to check effect of social progress on susceptibility against human trafficking and modern slavery, and business opportunities in the nation. Further, there is almost no empirical evidence which suggest that SPI is better scale than GDP or HDI in predicating different social measure. Therefore, data of 124 countries regarding SPI, HDI, GDP, Vulnerability to Enslavement, and Distance to Frontier score was collected for Year 2014. Secondary data analysis was performed and Simple Regression analysis was carried out on data for hypothesis testing. As proposed, a positive relationship of SPI and Ease of Doing Business was observed whereas negative relation was found between SPI and Vulnerability of Enslavement. In addition, SPI explain variation in both Vulnerability of Enslavement and Ease of Doing Business better than GDP and HDI, thereby providing evidence of its superior representation of social measures.

Title:  Monetary policy transmission: Does the credit channel perform in Cameroon? 
Abstract:  This article evaluates the monetary policy transmission through the credit channel in a macroeconomic GDP targeting approach with evidence in Cameroon. We use a macroeconomic approach based on the time series method. On data from the 1960-2012 period, statistical tests reveal the existence of successive causality between macroeconomic variables of the credit channel, confirming the existence of this channel in Cameroon. The Autoregresive vectors modeling (VAR) analysis then reveals a delay of two years in the GDP reaction from the monetary impulses, and that the credit channel is narrow with a low rate in Cameroon, a central African Developing country.

Title:  Foreign direct investment and economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa: The role of institutions
Abstract:   In this paper, we examine the impact of FDI on economic growth condition on the role of quality of institutions. To address our objective, we use the fixed effect and GMM models for analysis. A sample of 36 countries from Sub Saharan Africa was used for period from 2001 to 2015. The empirical results show that FDI has a significant negative effect on economic growth. Institutional quality on the other hand has a positive influence on economic growth.  Considering the interaction term between FDI and institutional quality, the empirical evidence show that institutional quality enhances the spillover effect from FDI and therefore do matter for economic growth. Using the GMM model the results confirm that good institutions are necessary for mediating the effects of FDI for economic growth.

Title:  Modeling persistence of volatility in the Moroccan exchange market using a fractionally integrated EGARCH
Abstract:  We have tried in this article to detect, examine, and analyze the persistence in the conditional volatility of the major Moroccan stock market index called MASI, using a fractionally integrated EGARCH model that has the property of capturing long memory along with shocks to the conditional volatility. A GARCH (1,1) and IGARCH models were also estimated for comparative purposes using Akaike, Schwarz and log likelihood information criterion. We used daily returns of MASI index covering the period between 04/01/1993 and 03/02/2017. Our results confirm the presence of a strong persistence in the volatility of the Moroccan index which is inconsistent with the weak efficiency form of Fama’s efficient markets hypothesis. The findings of this study could be of particular use to investors and academics interested in the forecasting of daily volatility in the Moroccan context. This paper broadens previous long memory estimation research by applying a FIEGARCH specification enabling it, not only to account for persistence, but also, to measure the leverage effect. Moreover, we believe that, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to model the volatility of the Moroccan stock market using a FIEGARCH approachng.

Title:  The distribution and determinants of Turkey’s FDI positions in Africa
Abstract:  This study investigates the key determinants of Turkey’s FDI positions in Africa by employing the gravity model. The major objective is to identify the core macroeconomic, socio-cultural, political, and governance-related determinants. PMLE is used in order to efficiently test the impact of dummy variables. Besides, three different models are estimated – the whole Africa, SSA and North African countries to investigate the variations in the FDI factors within the continent. The results illustrate that GDP size, per capita income, improvement in economic freedom and corruption levels, sharing common religion, improvement in easiness of doing businesses, and better political stability are attracting FDI from Turkey to Africa in general and SSA in particular. In the North African region, the FDI positions of Turkey are increasing in parallel to the GDP growth of Turkey, its import volume and the macroeconomic conditions of the hosting economiesh.

Title:  Theoretical bases on the nature of goodwill
Abstract:  Goodwill has been for over a decade a subject of debates and discussions trying to define the concept: its definition, its nature, its recognition. Indeed, the state of research witnesses to the abundant studies using different methodologies. Through this article we will try to make an overview to discuss the concept, its composition and classification. Beginning with a historical overview describing the appearance and theories related to goodwill, this article will be an overview that attempts to bring opinions and definitions given by researchers and then analyze the factors that determine the motivations of the managers of an acquiring company to pay more to the acquired firm the goodwill. In all these definitions, we present a critical opinion to obtain a theoretical and understandable basis for goodwill

They were usually managed and audited by state officials, supported when they were in need, employed people around the government. In other words these kind of Ottoman foundations were not independent from economic, social or political aspects of the Empire. Moreover accounting books could be benefited understanding the foundations’ structure, management, wealth and public services. In this study Kethuda Canfeda Hatun Foundations to be decided to analyze according to seventeenth century accounting books. She had been in Sultan Murad III.’s (1574-1595)imperial harem as an administrative manager during late sixteenth century. She built foundations in Istanbul, Ottoman Izmit and Egypt.

Title:  The artisanal silk industry of West Bengal: A study of its history, performance and current problems
Abstract:  Artisanal silk industry is a highly labour and land intensive activity ideally suited for economy like India. During medieval period, it was practiced as a dependable livelihood and Moghul Rulers were the patronizers. By 16th Century, commercial production of silk was started in Bengal by Sultan Hussain Shah. From the mid of 17th century, silk trade in India started flourishing since the demand for cheaper Bengal Silk began to rise in the European market. British traders realized that only low price of silk would not be enough to retain their market, and they introduced Piedmontese technology, though it was not suitable for Bengal economy at that point of time. After cessation of monopoly trade right, EEIC started selling off its filatures, thus spelling its gradual decline. After independence, attempts were made to transplant the temperate sericulture technology in the traditional silk producing states of India. West Bengal failed to bring the desired result both in domestic and export front, primary reason being large production of nistari multivoltine, while the export intensive bivoltine silk production is grossly ignored. During 2007-2012, the production of raw silk rose from 1660MT to 1924 MT, but the employment generation showed an enormous decline from 3.03 to 2.71 lakhs. The primary analysis in the Malda district explains that number of man-days generated from different phases of silk-worm rearing activity influences the total income generation of the artisans. On the other hand, cost of machineries and loans taken by household farms have positive effects on income generation of the sericulture farms. The primary analysis also reveals that area of mulberry cultivation, educational background of family head and total man-days creation have an inverse impact on the level of average employment generation in rural sericulture, while rise in household size and numbers of male and female hired labour have positive impact on the level of employment generation in a sericulture family farm. Employment of women generates a superior impact on the nutritional and educational level of the children and this study shows that higher percentage of female members in the household, wage accruals to the hired female workers and family empowerment of female members raise the gender pre-dominance of the sericulture farms.

Title: Fiscal deficit and inflation rate in selected African Regional Blocs: A comparative analysis
Abstract: This study investigates the effect of fiscal deficit on inflation rate in selected African countries. The data collected spans 22 years from 1994 to 2015. The countries considered are Egypt, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and South Africa. The selection of these countries was based on the countries with highest fiscal deficit or inflation rate in each of the geo-political zones in Africa. Based on the nature of the data, an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) in the context of Keynesian model of aggregate expenditure was specified and estimated. The result shows that inflation effect of fiscal deficit is country specific and period specific. Out of the five countries considered, it is only in Nigeria and South Africa that inflation is affected positively by fiscal deficit in the short run. In the long run, Nigeria is the only country where inflation rate is affected positively by fiscal deficit. In Egypt, there was no short run effect of fiscal deficit while in Kenya, there was negative effect. Recommendations were proffered based on these results.

Title: Health and economic growth in Sudan: Cointegration and Granger causality analysis (1969-2015)
Abstract: The relationship between human health and economic growth is complex. Its analysis is further complicated by the indicators used to measure health as indirectly observed. Improved health status requires increases in supply and demand for health care services driven by both economic and non-economic factors including GDP, GDP Per capita, inflation, population, fertility rates, life expectancy at birth, morbidity and mortality rates as well as education. On the other hand, health improvements measured for example by reductions in child mortality rates and increases in life expectancy rates have proven positive effects on economic growth. This study sought to explain the interplay between the state of health and economic growth in Sudan. The study is mainly an empirical investigation employing the econometric methods of Johansen cointegration test, the vector error correction modeling (VECM) and Granger causality analysis using annual time series data for the period 1969-2015. The cointegration test shows that a long-run equilibrium relationship exists between health status and economic growth. The VECM results show that health expenditure, under-five mortality and immunization have significant positive effects on economic growth in the long run, while total investment and CO2 emissions have no significant effect on GDP. In the short run, total investment and CO2 emissions have significant negative effect on GDP though in two years period. In the short run, GDP is mostly and significantly affected by total health expenditure and immunization but not by the under-five mortality rates. The error correction term has the correct negative sign showing that the dependent variable GDP converges to steady state equilibrium at speed of 32%. Granger causality analysis shows a unidirectional relationship running from GDP to health expenditure, while a unidirectional relationship running from under-five mortality rate to GDP is established. CO2 emissions are found to cause GDP with no sign of feedback effect. The study recommends that government should ensure macroeconomic stability in terms of stable growth, increase the resources to the health sector in order to achieve the under-five mortality MDG and effective coordination with donors to ensure full coverage of children immunization.

Title: Corruption and health care provision: An extension of the Shleifer and Vishny’ Model
Abstract: The problem that arises is how the State official in a monopoly situation maximizes the value of bribes collected, by selling public services to users? To answer this question, we show first that in the case of health care provision, the Shleifer and Vishny’ simple monopoly model which highlights two forms of corruption (with theft and without theft) is limited insofar as it underestimates not only the value of bribes likely to be collected, but also the loss of income that corrupt practices cause to public services. Our model rather reveals that the State agent in a monopoly situation can discriminate users according to their characteristics in order to collect more possible bribes. Indeed, our model shows that when a medical doctor maximizes its earnings and whatever the form of corruption practiced, he plays not only on amounts of bribes paid and a part of the official price, but also on users’ characteristics. However, for some amounts the State agent will tend to practice the form of corruption without theft on certain users’ characteristics where he/she would draw the greatest possible gain.

Title: Is there a long-run association between globalization and productivity: The case of Turkey
Abstract: This study examines short and long-run association between globalization and productivity by using a time series sample of Turkey covering the years from 1970 to 2014. Firstly, I check the stationarity status of the series and following that I conduct a cointegration analysis among series in the framework of ARDL boundary test technique. After that, both short-run and long-run coefficients are gathered by using error corrected form of ARDL Model. In addition to that, I provide the results for diagnostic check of the model. Eventually, a causality test is applied to see if there is a causal relationship between the series. According to the findings, globalization and productivity series are cointegrated and it is found that there is a long-run significant positive impact of globalization on productivity while this figure is negative for short-run. Moreover the test results for causality test imply that there exists just one unidirectional causality running from globalization to productivity.

Title: Environment case study: Forestry and water management in Thailand: A win win situation
Abstract: The article offers a critique for the argument that forest clearing by the people in the upper areas of the watershed is the main reason for decrease in water supply. Instead he considers increased demand of water for agricultural activity especially during dry season by both upstream and downstream areas as the main cause of water shortage. Thus unlike previous studies, who blame people from upper lands for water shortage, he talks about the fair share of scare resources and rights protection for upstream farmers.

Title: Development induced displacement of rural communities in India: A critical review
Abstract: This article analyses the impact of recent modernisation-led development on rural communities, emphasising particularly their loss of land and of access to common land. Displacement of rural communities from their natural habitats results in a host of socio-economic impacts. This study will focus mainly on farmers and tribal communities in India - as to how they have been affected by the modernisation process, especially since the adoption of neoliberal economic reforms in the early 1990s. The paper argues that the process of displacement has been accelerated due to the expansion of mining, infrastructure and industrial projects. The study finds that the displacement has led to impoverishment, marginalisation and social disarticulation of rural communities. It concludes that development policies should be more inclusive and sensitive to the needs of displaced communities.

Title: Measurement and assessment of the evolution of technology with a simple biological model
Abstract: A simple model of the development of technology is presented. This model, in a broad analogy with evolutionary ecology of parasites, within a theoretical framework of Generalized Darwinism, can explain vital characteristics of technological advances and technological evolution. In particular, the evolution of technology is modelled here in terms of morphological changes between a host technology and a main subsystem of technology. The coefficient of evolutionary growth of this simple model here indicates the grade and type of the evolution of technology. This coefficient is quantified in real cases study using historical data of farm tractor, freight locomotive and electricity generation technology in steam-powered plants and internal-combustion plants. The approach of measurement and assessment of technological evolution proposed here seems to be appropriate in grasping the dynamics of technological evolution to predict which technologies are likeliest to evolve rapidly.

Title: An empirical analysis of the impact of floating exchange rate on balance of payment in Nigeria (1986 - 2016)
Abstract: This paper empirically investigates the impact of floating exchange rate on balance of payment in Nigeria during 1986–2016. Unit root test, cointegration test, VEC Granger causality/Exogeneity Wald test and Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) were econometric tools used to establish the relationship between exchange rate and balance of payment. The results showed a positive and statistically significant relationship in both short-run and long-run between balance of payment and exchange rate of the Nigerian Economy during the period under review. The VEC Granger Causality/Block Exogeneity further revealed that the major determinants of exchange rate are real GDP and money supply. It further reveals that the nexus among the variables runs from government expenditure to real GDP and money supply to exchange rate, and then to Balance of Payment. Therefore it was recommended amongst other things that the policy of exchange rate depreciation should be maintained but with government intervention guide. Government through Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should apply expenditure reducing monetary policies through money supply and domestic credit to promote favourable BOT which invariably stabilizes BOP.

Title: The impact of sudden stops in capital flows on output and investment: Selected emerging markets
Abstract: We evaluate how vulnerable the emerging markets are to sudden stops, that is, capital inflow reversals, using panel data for 12 emerging economies for the period 1976–2002 that experienced such reversals. We investigate the impact of sudden stops on the macroeconomic indicators of economic growth and investment by employing the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimation methodology. A robustness check is performed using regional groups and introducing additional control variables. We find that sudden stops have lagging, negative, and robust effect on output and investment, while the effect on investment is not always robust.

Title: The relationship between Bitcoin, gold and foreign exchange returns: The case of Turkey
Abstract: This study focuses on the dollar, euro, gold, bitcoin and the impact of bubbles in financial investment instruments on bitcoin returns in the context of Turkey. The causal relationships (using the Toda-Yamamato causality test) between the returns of these financial instruments were also determined. In performing this assessment, the sup augmented Dickey-Fuller (SADF) and generalised SADF (GSADF) tests were employed to determine the existence of bubbles based on the period from 1 August 2018 to 23 March 2018. The volatility of bitcoin was tested by autoregressive conditional variant models. As a result, it was shown that the observed bubbles in gold’s, the euro’s and the dollar’s returns reduced the volatility of bitcoin’s returns. Then, it was shown that the dollar’s, the euro’s and gold’s returns affected bitcoin’s returns.

Title: The crisis and its consequences for society and economic theory
Abstract: The Financial Crisis (2007–09; FC) has shown that the assumptions of the neoliberal paradigm are not sufficient. The FC has also led to a Moral Crisis (MC). Ethical standards in business are deteriorating. Institutions and authorities have significantly lost their reputation due to the FC and right-wing populism has gained political influence worldwide. This political agenda will disappear due to its own contradictions. This paper will also show that the crisis is a crisis of theory. Economics as a science is stagnating since several decades, because of its institutionalization in economic journals and in the academic environment which is conserving old methods and thinking styles. Economic theories of today are not appropriate for the solution of the actual problems. Progress in economic theory is urgently needed, because the prevailing paradigm does not solve the problems of income inequality, high unemployment levels and the destruction of the ecological sphere. The doctrine of permanent economic growth as well as austerity measures have to be scrutinized. The constantly rising pressure of unsolved problems in economics resp. economic theory must lead to a change of the current paradigm.

Title: The effect of foreign trade on economic growth: The case of Turkey
Abstract: In this study, the causal relationships between export, import and economic growth in Turkey are analysed, using quarterly data from 1987 to 2017. In order to examine these relationships a number of econometric methods are applied, such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Unit Root Test, Johansen Cointegration Test and Granger Causality Test based on the Error Correction Model. The results show that all variables are stationary in the first difference. Furthermore, the validity of long-run relationships among variables is found by the Johansen cointegration test. Since the cointegration is observed between series, the Error Correction Model is used to determine the causality. The empirical findings from the causality test suggest that there is short-term bidirectional causality between economic growth and import in Turkey. On the other hand, according to the Error Correction Model, there is a long run unidirectional causality from economic growth to export in Turkey.

Title: Re-examining the equation of exchange according to Shariah rationale money
Abstract: Earlier, the Muslim scholars stated that money is a social convention. For instance, Ibn Taymiyyah (1263–1328) indicated that the gold standard money constitutes a pricing system or a rationale money. Ibn Khaldun (1377) urged a stable monetary policy by using Shariah currency which is related to the number of transactions, and the monetary policy was done through a control and a supervision by a Shariah board office as a monetary authority. The focus point in all transactions is to forbid the Riba including the banking interest rate. Inside the Shariah paradigm and according to historical economic facts revealed by Ibn Khaldun, we suggest that the economic theory of money, through the equation of exchange, should be re-examined by treating the value of transactions and the velocity of money as endogenous, and considering the stock of money as exogenous and determined only by the monetary authority. We expect that when the consumers and producers as buyers and sellers behave following the Shariah transactions by avoiding any form of unfair dealing, the speculative money will tend to zero and all the money stock will be in circulation. It is best for community welfare that the money reaches its optimal velocity by improving the trade between members of the society. Such Shariah statement would be realized at least through the Zakat system and by any form of re-distribution of the wealth or social giving. The implementation of a new gold standard system requires a political decision and the flexibility of the market prices processes. Even if money is just an instrument, it is perceived differently in Islamic and non-Islamic perspectives. The practical prescriptions (i)-(ii)-(iii) based on Shariah transactions perception and Islamic economics paradigm would fit more for the mankind that needs justice and fairness.

Title: A financial option perspective on OPEC strategy
Abstract: The article examines the use of discretionary production by key OPEC members to protect the long-term value of their reserves. Although interpretations vary on its behaviour and market power, the organisation sees its role as promoting the security of supply through stabilising markets while protecting market share and ensuring a fair return to capital. Given the new and perennial challenges facing its members, there are diverse views on how these policy objectives may be promoted. Using option theory, we argue that the market stabilisation policy of OPEC in effect, provides free risk management to the global market and conflicts fundamentally with its long-term objective of protecting market share through discouraging high-cost marginal producers. Abandoning this policy, the returns to marginal producers, adjusted for risk, would be reduced. As implications of our research, rather than creating a social good through mitigating price risk, OPEC should allow markets to be volatile and even consider using its discretionary buffer in a pro-cyclic manner, to protect the long-term value of its reserves.

Title: A brief history of Pakistan’s democratic journey
Abstract: The paper analyses Pakistan’s journey through 2008 to 2018 in establishing strong democratic precedence and rule of law that the analysis suggests is finally transforming into structural changes in the economy while further strengthening its institutional and macro-economic governance. With every new democratic government in place after completing its turn as mandated by constitution of Pakistan, in the last ten years the country has been addressing many challenges that have emerged as an aftermath of dictatorial rule of President Musharraf. Though President Musharraf remains to be an enlightened autocrat taking some important steps to strengthen the economy but his government witnessed a steep slide in social trust among people of Pakistan amid armed conflict in Afghanistan that took an ugly turn and affected Pakistani social and ethical fabric due to porous nature of Durand Line.

Title: Value creation by Indian companies: A comparative study over two time periods
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to derive economic profit generated by Indian companies over two time periods and see whether there has been any fundamental change in the performance of companies and the sectors within which they belong. We focus on non-finance companies. The purpose is two-fold. First, to get an idea about how Indian companies have fared over the two time periods and whether there has been any structural change. Second, to help companies decide on their next strategic move and allocate funds for the purpose. The study also focusses on the relationship between size and economic profit, where invested capital and market capitalization represents size. The methodology presented in the paper enables us to understand the performance of Indian companies and also the sectors within which they belong.

Title: Growth-youth unemployment nexus in upper-middle-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
Abstract: The issue concerning growth-youth unemployment nexus has not been verified with respect to upper middle-income countries (UMIC) in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The importance of this paper is to ascertain the relationship between economic growth and youth unemployment based on panel and individual countries data in term of annual series data from 1991 to 2017. To achieve the objective of this paper, data were sourced from the World Bank development indicators, for GDP growth rate and youth unemployment rate. Several statistical and econometric tests were conducted, the results obtained revealed that the average GDP-growth rate was 6.36% while youth unemployment rate was 32.30% for UMIC in SSA. The empirical results indicated that there exists a long-run and positive relationship between the variables of GDP-growth rate and youth unemployment rate in UMIC in SSA and that Okun’s law is not applicable in these countries.

Title: Evolving economic growth via the human capital development paradigm: Evidence from the Francophone West-African economies
Abstract: This research examined the impact of Human Capital Development (HCD) on economic growth among the ten French-Speaking West African Countries. Panel data analysis was used in capturing the relationship between human capital development and economic growth in the West Africa sub region. The endogeneity problem often associated with panel data analysis was accounted for through the use of the Generalized Method of Moments. From the Arellano-bond dynamic panel estimation, it revealed that secondary school levers (SSE6), those who enrolled for a minimum of four years at the tertiary school level (TSE4) and gross capital formation (GCF) were statistically significant in determining economic growth among the Francophone countries in West Africa.

Title: The new models of decision in risk: A critical review of the literature
Abstract: The aim of the risk decision theory is to describe the behavior of agents in the face of several random prospects. Since it is difficult to describe these preferences, we seek to represent them. The use of a representative function of preferences has been for a long time, the usual method of describing behavior in a random context. The obvious advantage of this method is that it allows including these data in a formalized model and, by extension, to understand the optimization process underlying any decision. The determination of the representative function of preferences must be based on an axiomatic basis. From these axioms, an accurate specification of the value function will be derived. The purpose of this article is to examine the history of theories that have sought to determine a satisfactory criterion for responding to the risk decision problem and to analyze the contribution of these models.

Title: Gender parity index in primary school in rural India: An analysis
Abstract: Patriarchal forces have imposed many subjective norms on girls in achieving education mainly in rural India. Initially on the basis of 2011 Census report of India, the rural population dominated districts of 16 major states of India are identified. Next we have tried to identify the possible factors which can influence Gender Parity Index (GPI) during the time of enrolment in primary education in rural India. Due to disparity in socio-cultural factors across india, which can possibly influence girl’s enrolment in primary school, we have divided India into four zones. This paper on the basis of DISE statistics have found that school development grant influences GPI in Eastern, Western and Southern zones and teaching learning material grant influence GPI value in Eastern and Western zone and also encourages overall enrolment of children in Northern zone in rural schools. It is also found that increased female teacher positively influences GPI value in primary school enrolment in Eastern and Southern zone of India. Reduced pupil-teacher ratio has positive impact on girls enrolment in primary school mainly in Eastern, Western and Southern zone of India. Availibility of mid day meal in school has positively influenced GPI value in primary school enrolment in Eastern, Western and Southern zone of India and also have positive impact in increasing overall enrolment in rural primary schools in Northern zone of India. Female literacy and overall literacy have positive influence GPI in Eastern zone of India. Provision for specialised toilet for girl child has also motivated parents to enrol their girl child to primary school mainly in Eastern, Western and Southern zone of India.

Title: Energy subsidy reform and economic sustainability: Egypt vs. Iran
Abstract: This paper illustrates the relationship between energy reforms and economic sustainable development in Egypt and Iran; through analyzing the relation between energy reform and four main macroeconomic variables, namely: budget deficit, energy consumption, inflation and economic growth. The methodology adopted in this paper is a comparative case study between Egypt and Iran, using qualitative descriptive analysis; focusing on the period from 2010 to 2014, as this period is characterized with active subsidy reform efforts for both countries. The paper concludes that reforming energy subsidies generally tends to relief the strain on the public budget, in case it is not accompanied with simultaneous economic difficulties which can deem the reform efforts obsolete, like in the case of Iran. In addition, the responsiveness of energy consumption of a certain fuel to the increase in its price is heavily reliant on its price elasticity of demand. This is represented in the availability of alternative energy sources. Moreover, the effect of the reforms on inflation is normally instantaneous and short-lived and could be mitigated through government intervention; that was clear in the case of Egypt. However, Iran did not show a similar trend as there was a weak correlation between subsidy reforms and inflation. Finally, there tends to be a very weak relationship between subsidy reforms and GDP growth, implying that the effect of other economic factors outweighs that of subsidy reforms.

Title: Biswajit Nag & Debashis Chakraborty (eds), India’s Trade Analytics: Patterns and Opportunities
Abstract: India, a leading developing country, initiated the process of trade liberalization since early nineties, but the wider effects of the reforms started taking shape only in the new millennium. The unilateral trade policy reforms undertaken by the country were supplemented by the WTO-induced liberalization measures from mid-nineties onwards. The investment liberalizations ushered in updated technology and global management practices across sectors. The internal policy reforms as well as the evolving global trade architecture created a number of winner sectors across the Indian economy, e.g., – tea and spices, fisheries (agriculture), garments, leather products, automobiles (manufacturing) and IT services (services). Confident with growing export potential as well as the rising trade openness in the partner countries, India started entering into a number of regional trade agreements (RTAs), primarily in Asia, from 2005 onwards.

Title: ‘We are (the) Middle Class’ The new Turkish middle class: identification, behaviors and expectations
Abstract: This article aims to identify and characterise the Turkish middle class. Our objective is to improve its description by implementing a clustering method combining an economic and a sociological approach. Using the Income and Living Conditions Survey (2014), we first identify the middle-class on the basis of an income interval. We then use information about employment and education to characterise the heterogeneity of this middle-income class. The distinctive behaviors and aspirations of four middle class groups are explored in depth by using the results of original qualitative field research carried out among middle class households from two contrasting regions.

Title: Intertemporal modeling of the current account
Abstract: This paper explores the long-run current account to GDP ratio in the present value model framework (PVMCA). Firstly, we use Euler equation at macro level to identify a general equation of the per capita current account to GDP. Secondly, through the overlapping generations model we determine the equation of per-capita CA using relevant variables, and discuss the empirical validity of the PVMCA via the quasi-elasticity of CA-to-GDP with respect to the per capita growth rate of output and consumption. We show that the elasticities of CA-to-GDP to per-capita output and to per-capita consumption growths interact in opposite paths, meaning that a higher growth rate of consumption tomorrow involves more saving yesterday and brings up a positive current account balance.

Title: Forecasting volatility of gold: Comparison of Turkish gold and equity markets’ risk profile
Abstract: Predicting price changes of a commodity thus, forecasting volatility thereof have significant importance for the risk measurement purpose. Perception is that the highly volatile assets overreact more under stressed market conditions, cause excessive volatility and are traded with a discount. In this paper, we evaluated volatility structure of gold and equity markets in Turkey with GARCH volatility modeling methodology, an extended version of ARCH model. Comparison of volatility clustering and overall risk profile of both markets was made. The results show that persistence exists in the volatility process and current conditional volatility of gold prices is significantly impacted by its own past shocks and volatility. The results also confirms the volatility clustering that high volatilities are likely to be pursued by high ones and vice versa in both gold and equity markets. Parallel to literature finding, gold is a diversification instrument because of its low correlation with stock markets and its low risk profile feature induced with low volatilities in gold markets than equity markets.

Title: A plan for dollarizing Argentina
Abstract: For many reasons, dollarization is an efficient and realistic option for this country. Yet, in order to last, it must be able to withstand banking panics without the assistance of a conventional lender of last resort and the lobby of protected industries to revoke dollarization. To this end, we advance a model of commercial banking close to that of Panama, under foreign law, and argue for free trade agreements with superpowers to smooth out real-exchange rate fluctuations.

Abstract: This paper empirically estimates the relationship among selected variables—trade, agricultural value-added, foreign direct investments, domestic credit to private sectors, official exchange rate, gross capital formation, and population—for Southeast Asian economies including Pakistan, China, Malaysia, India, and South Korea during 1985–2016. Using the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the study finds a long-run association among national credit to private sectors, foreign direct investment, population, and gross capital formation. Gross capital formation significantly contributes to trade in both the long and short run. While national credit, FDI, and population show a supportive but statistically insignificant relationship with trade, agricultural value-added and the official exchange rate exhibit a negative association. The findings suggest that investment in fixed assets and infrastructure is crucial for attracting FDI and boosting trade in the selected economies.

Title: The effects of monetary policy on housing prices
Abstract: Many factors have an impact on housing prices. Among these factors, short term interest rates have significant importance. It is because changes in short term interests are important indicators of the efficiency of the monetary policy and the functioning of the housing prices channel is an important tool for the monetary authority to have an impact on economic activities. The purpose of this paper is to study the efficiency of the housing prices channel in Turkey. In our study, we used VAR method based on data from 2007–2019. As a result of the analysis, we found out that interest rates and the housing credit index directly affect housing prices in Turkey.

Title: Non-oil export and economic growth in Nigeria: A disaggregated analysis
Abstract: This study examined the impact of non-oil export on economic growth in Nigeria using disaggregated data. The study employed annual time series data from 1981 to 2017 sourced from Central Bank of Nigeria Statistical Bulletin. The study adopted the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to estimate the short and long run relationship between non-oil export and economic growth. The findings revealed that agricultural and manufacturing exports have positive and significant impact on economic growth both in the short and long run. Solid minerals export has positive but insignificant impact on economic growth. The study recommends that government should create enabling environment for non-oil export to thrive through provision of infrastructure, access to credit facilities and stable macroeconomic policies.

Title: Diagnosis of the process of agrarian and rural digitalization in Bulgaria
Abstract: Despite its big theoretical and practical importance in Bulgaria there are no comprehensive analysis of the state and evolution of digitalization in agriculture and rural areas. The goal of this study is to analyze the state, development and efficiency of digitalization in the agrarian sphere in Bulgaria, specify major trends in that area, compare the situation with other EU countries, identify main problems, and make recommendation for improving policies in the next programing period. Analysis has found out that in recent years there is considerable improvement of the access of Bulgarian households to internet as well as a significant increase in the persons using internet for relations with public institutions and trading goods and services. Nevertheless, Bulgaria is quite behind from other EU members in regards to introduction of digital technologies in the economy and society taking one of the last places in EU in terms of Integral Index for Introduction of Digital Technologies in the Economy and Society – DESI. There is a great variation on the extent of digitalization in different subsectors of agriculture, farms of different juridical type and size, and different regions of the country. Most agricultural holdings are not aware with the content of digital agriculture as 14% apply modern digital technologies. Major obstacles for introduction of digital technologies are qualification of employees, amount of required investment, unclear economic benefits, and data security. Main areas where state administration actions are required are: support of measures for supplementary training of labor, tax preferences in planning of actions and digitalization of activity, stimulation of young specialists, introduction of internationally recognized processes of standardization and certification, adaptation of legislation in the area of data protection, and securing reliable and high speed networks.

Title: Non-timber forest incomes and economic welfare in the South-West region of Cameroon: The incidence of rural income inequality
Abstract: With the aim of answering the question whether or not Non-Timber Forest Products can contribute in reducing rural income inequality in the South-West region of Cameroon, the study used primary data collected from a survey on 408 rural household heads. The Data was collected using a structured questionnaire. We adopted three different methodologies – The Gini Coefficient, The Lorenz curve, and The Income Decomposition by income sources to obtain identical results. The results revealed that incomes from non-timber forest products reduces rural income inequality in the rural parts of the region significantly, and occupy an important position amongst the different income sources which were investigated. We therefore recommend improved value-added for Non-Timber Forest Products through processing. A better management of the forest in general and the forest resources in particular will ensure improved benefits to the community as a whole especially in the areas of total income and income inequality.

Title: Taxation and strategic reaction: a comparison of Cournot, Stackelberg and collusion
Abstract: We study the effect of distortionary taxes on three types of market structure: Cournot duopoly, Stackelberg duopoly, and a monopoly under a collusive agreement between the two rival firms in the industry. We investigate different tax regimes such as a per unit tax, an ad valorem tax and a tax on total revenue. A unit tax rate reduces optimal output and profits for firms while market price rises with the imposition of the tax. Interestingly, the optimal tax rate is the same for all three market structures. The ad valorem tax is imposed on the value of the product and is mostly borne by the Stackelberg follower who ends up producing a greater output than what he would produce in the absence of a tax. The ad valorem tax increases firm output and reduces market price. The total revenue decreases output and increases industry price like the unit tax.

Title: The relationship between the GDP, FDI, and non-oil exports in the Saudi economy - 1970-2019: Evidence from (VECM) and (ARDL) assessment - according to Vision 2030
Abstract: This study examines the long-term and short-term balance relationship of GDP, Foreign Direct Investment to the performance of nonoil exports in KSA within the framework of the export-led growth (ELG) hypothesis: Evidence from ARDL, VECM and a smaller evaluation according to Vision 2030. We performed an analysis for the period from 1970 to 2019 by an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and checked the robustness of the results in the vector error correction (VECM) model. The co-integration and Toda - Yamamoto causality analysis are conducted by using two techniques of vector error correction model (VECM) and autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL). The main findings are: Foreign direct investment can increase GDP growth rates by increasing non-oil exports in the Saudi economy according to the results of the Toda - Yamamoto Causality Test; and the GDP in the Saudi economy are affected by FDI and the rates of non-oil exports, in the long and short term, and the reason is the strength of the reserves of the Saudi economy. The contribution of this research is that the outcomes found by means of econometric models can be used for predicting and measuring GDP in upcoming years, can get a guideline from this research To the economic policy makers in Saudi Arabia. Also, the dynamic interaction among FDI, non-oil exports, and economic growth is investigated using the ARDL. The ARDL co-integration results showed that GDP, FDI and non-oil exports are co-integrated, indicating the presence of a long-run equilibrium relationship between them. Besides, the results for the relationship between GDP, FDI and Non-Oil Exports are interesting and indicate that there is no significant from variables and vice-versa using Toda-Yamamoto causality.

Title: Impact of COVID 19 on international trade and China’s trade
Abstract: As COVID-19 emerged from China and spread around the world like a pandemic, it was not just a health disease threat perhaps it could affect the world economically, politically, socially and educationally so, this research is conducted to find the impact of COVID-19 on international trade and China’s trade. To determine the effects of COVID-19 on global trade, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on forty-two countries using computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. These components comprise things such as industries, governments, importers and exporters, investors, and households. The results were obtained by using 2018 data from the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The impact of Covid-19 on GDP has been predicted under two scenarios. These are the short and long containment scenarios. Under the short containment scenario, global trade will be cut by about 905 billion US Dollars. Global trade will be cut by 2,095 billion US Dollars under the long containment scenario. From the simulation, growth in GDP will fall by 5.4 percent under the short containment scenario growth in GDP will fall by 3.7 percent in Asia and by 2.8 percent in the world, Asia is expected to contribute the most to the general decline in global output by a figure of 48 percent. Covid-19 will impact wage income most in the EU, UK, and the US. On a global scale, labor income will fall by 535 billion US Dollars under the short containment scenario. Labor income will fall by 1053 billion US Dollars under the long containment scenario. China is the core of export and import in Asia and COVID-19 could affect the Asia negatively so it could be concluded that COVID-19 could affect the China’s trade indirectly during the COVID-19.

Title: Volatility stylized facts in the Moroccan stock market: Evidence from both aggregate and disaggregate data
Abstract: Financial markets in emerging countries are generating considerable literature, aiming to understand their organization, perspective, and performance. In this context, few studies have expressed interest in the Moroccan financial market and even fewer researches have addressed the issue of the Moroccan financial market volatility. In this paper, we investigate variety of common properties, labelled as “stylized facts.” Our results show that global and sectoral indices of Moroccan Stock Market share the majority of stylized facts. In fact, absolute returns correlation coefficients are positive and tend to decay at a much slower pace. Hence, volatility of Moroccan Stock Market captures the properties of volatility clustering and long memory. We also find evidence of volatility asymmetry. Yet, the level is not statistically significant for most of the indices. More interestingly, the Omori law indicates that Moroccan Stock market is relatively stable after financial shocks.

Title: The allocation of time in public administrations subject to bribery in developing countries: The basic model of labour supplu revisited
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to revisit the basic model of labour supply taking into account the existence of corruption in public administrations in developing countries. The worker-consumer programme modified by the integration of bribery shows that at equilibrium, the optimal solution leads to a Marginal Rate of Substitution of leisure consumption equal to the real contractual wage rate plus the actual bribe rate. Because of the latter, the reserve wage is no longer an essential determinant for participating in the labour market. Corruption seems to amplify the substitution and income effects.

Title: Agrarian research and development in Bulgaria during EU membership
Abstract: Despite the great theoretical and practical significance, in Bulgaria there are no comprehensive analysis of the state and evolution of agrarian research and development (ARD) activities. The goal of this paper is to analyze the state and evolution of ARD in Bulgaria during the period after country’s EU accession in 2007, identify major trends in that area, make a comparison with other EU states, specify main problems, and suggest conclusions for improvement of policies during next programing period. The analysis has found out that in years of EU membership the expenditures for ARD significantly decreased absolutely and relatively as a share in the total expenditures for R&D, which indicates diminishing importance, and deteriorating financial, personnel and material potential of agrarian knowledge and innovation sector. The most important sector for ARD in the country is the government in which more than 80% of overall expenditures for ARD are invested, as distribution of expenditures and organization of R&D in major sectors differ considerably from other EU member states. ARD in the country mainly are funded by the state budget, and the importance of budget financing relatedly increases during the period, unlike trends in other EU countries.

Title: Determinants of national innovation capacity in developing countries: An empirical survey
Abstract: National innovation capacity is seen as the main source of sustainable growth and prosperity of countries. National innovation capacity, being both an economic and political asset, is defined as the potential of a country to produce innovation. At the same time, measuring the capacity of national innovation provides important information about the dynamics of innovation in the field of economics. Also, it is seen that most of the studies on national innovation capacity have focused on developed countries. In this study, it is aimed to make an empirical analysis of the determinants of national innovation capacity in developing countries in comparison with developed countries. For this purpose, variables considered to be determinants of national innovation capacity are classified under three headings as national technological capability and infrastructure factors, external factors, and institutional factors. In most studies in the literature, national innovation capacity is represented only by the number of patents in the empirical analysis. However, in most of these studies, the disadvantages and deficient aspects of representing national innovation capacity only with the number of patents are mentioned and almost no alternative methods have been suggested. Based on the suggestions and methods in empirical studies, the national innovation capacity index is calculated and represented as a new output variable representing the national innovation capacity in the effort to fill the relevant gap in the literature. In the study, data in the period of 1996-2016 are analyzed by the panel data analysis method for 18 developing countries and 31 developed countries. The effects of national technological capabilities and infrastructure factors of national innovation capacity in developing countries are seen to be weak. At the same time, it is seen that external factors have a positive effect on national innovation capacity in these countries and this indicates the dependence on foreign technologies in the development of technological capabilities.

Title: Impact of Covid-19 on the South African economy: A CGE, Holt-Winter and SARIMA model’s analysis
Abstract: The spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emanating from China touched South Africa like other countries across the world. This study analyses the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on South African economy and total revenue. For this purpose, we have made use of a single country’s Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model, Holt-Winter (HW) and SARIMA models by formulating one scenario based on the likely duration of the pandemic. In the scenario, we assume that the pandemic will last six months. The results indicate significant impacts on the macroeconomic variables, employment and sectoral level and on households’ well-being. First, at the macroeconomic level, the COVID-19 crisis resulted in a significant drop in the economic growth rate across all the macroeconomic variables. The Gross Domestic Product (GDP), exports and private consumption dropped by 7.10%, 13.19% and 7.10%, respectively. This represents a loss of real Gross Domestic Product of R338 billion. In contrast, the time series’ models project the state revenue to be around R1 104.5 trillion for Holt Winter model and R1 210 for SARIMA model, on average R1 157 trillion for the two models is expected. Furthermore, the models anticipate the loss in revenue at a region of R213.0 billion to a maximum of R318.2 billion from SARIMA and HW models, respectively for the same period. Moreover, the unemployment was expected to grow because of a sharp drop in sectoral productions. In addition, our findings reveal a contraction of sectoral exports. Finally, the rise of consumer prices and unemployment did greatly dampen the purchasing power of households.

Title: The Covid-19 pandemic uncertainty behavioural factor model
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic raised a few issues concerning how market participants react to a global pandemic. The pandemic was a black swan event on some levels; there had been few pandemics that have had such a global impact: the Spanish Flu of the late 1910s and 1957 influenza. Moreover, global interconnection means that the Covid-19 pandemic was able to spread across the globe quickly, thus indicating that extreme measures were needed to bring it under control. The policies taken by governments around the world had a significant adverse impact on the economy. It is with these factors in mind that we research the psychology of the market participants during the pandemic. Conversely, we introduce a new model of behaviour during uncertainty, which explains how market participants react during crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The model analyses the psychological issues, both emotional and cognitive, influencing the pandemic. We found that like any other crises, market participant reacted to government actions and announcements and the impact on the economy. Therefore, leading to the old issue of miscommunication and insufficient actions.

Title: Sukuk in the World and Turkey
Abstract: As a result of globalization, the integration initiatives of the international financial markets cause various problems. Moreover, these problems are not only limited to the country in which they occur, but can also spread to other countries by snowball-effect or transmission. When we review the world financial history, countries have often experienced financial crises in recent years. At the same time, they have developed various methods to eliminate or reduce the negative effects of crises. Sukuk issues made in a country change the effects of the financial crisis that country is exposed to. This is mainly because of the fact that the Sukuk instruments are insensitive to interest. In this paper, the case study method has been adopted. In accordance with this method, it is intended to make an assessment of the sukuk applications in the world and in Turkey.

Title: Over financial regulation and stability: Does it matters for bank efficiency in Nigeria?
Abstract: Banks play a key and critical role in society, mediating resources and assets around the economy between surpluses and household spending on deficits. Therefore, they have a great responsibility for sustainability and prosperity. This study is motivated by the need to investigate whether competition, regulation and stability are important for the efficiency of the Nigerian banking system. Data sourced from the World Development Indicators between 1996 and 2017 was used. The results show a negative and statistically significant relationship exists between financial regulation and efficiency of the banking sector. However, further results show a positive and statistically significant relationship exists between financial regulation and stability in the system. Thus, the study concludes by emphasizing the importance of stability and bank performance matters in Nigeria.

Title: How does atmospheric circulation affect the diffusion of Covid-19 in polluted cities?
Abstract: This paper endeavors to explain how wind speed can affect the diffusion of COVID-19. The statistical analysis, based on data from Italy, suggests that high wind speed can reduce air pollution commingled with viral agents and as a consequence reduce infected individuals of COVID-19; moreover, results reveal that polluted cities with low wind speed have a greater number of infected individuals and total deaths also because of bad air quality. This study suggests the important role of atmospheric pollution and atmospheric circulation in the transmission dynamics of the novel Coronavirus to support appropriate environmental policy to reduce concentration of pollutants in the atmosphere, improving air quality and human health.

Title: Exchange rate policy and sectoral competitiveness in Morocco: Vector autoregressive model
Abstract: The objective of this work is to study the exchange rate policy and its impact on sectoral competitiveness in Morocco. For this issue we used a VAR econometric model with annual data covering a period from 1990 to 2020. As a result of this study, we found that the exchange rate policy adopted and applied by the Moroccan monetary authorities showed that the real effective exchange rate experienced an appreciation that is, a loss of competitiveness. Thus, the monetary authorities have chosen the second course of action which is the gradual flexibility of the exchange rate regime and the improvement of the weak performance of exports. This is done through the diversification of production structures on the one hand and the diversification of exports on the other. Indeed, the overvaluation of the national currency results in a loss of competitiveness towards foreign countries, which means that domestic goods cost more than they should. Conversely, when the domestic currency is undervalued, this allows a gain in competitiveness.

Title: Imperative of corporate governance on industry's profitability: An empirical study of privatized cement industry in Nigeria
Abstract: The study investigates the imperative of corporate governance on profitability of privatized cement industry in Nigeria. The variables studied were Rate of Returns as dependent variables and fourteen Corporate Governance proxies as independent variables. Data was collected from secondary sources, and the statistical tools employed in the Methodology were descriptive statistics and Pooled OLS regressions. The study aimed at bridging literature gap on studies that relate corporate governance and privatization policy in Nigeria. The results suggest that, no remarkable improvement of profitability post privatization due to challenges of exogenous factors such as macroeconomic environment instability and weak private sector. The industry witnessed changes in corporate governance such as adopting effective cost management and proactive business strategies, exposure to competition, withdrawal of Government subsidy and special grant post privatisation. Board Size and Workforce have positive and significant impact on Cement industry’s profitability, while, State Ownership, Institutional Ownership, Minority ownership, Percentage of Executive Directors and Privatization with time have negative and significant impact on company’s profitability. Conversely, Foreign Investors, Percentage of Non-Executive Directors and Percentage of Management Staff have positive and insignificant impact on the Cement industry’s profitability. Thus, it will be pertinent to conclude that the result has accepted Alternative Hypothesis that corporate governance has significant impact on the Cement industry’s performance (AROA), despite the challenges of microeconomic environment instability. The study recommends that, Government needs to stabilize macroeconomic environment and strengthen private sector. The Cement Industry needs to ensure right procedure of the selection of Non-Executive Directors, create incentive for foreign investor participation, ensure Payment of dividend, less government interference and accountability. Mechanisms such as efficient and independent audit committee, competent executive directors and professional management team need to be put in place to address the negative and insignificant impact of management staff on the industry.

Title: Fiscal versus Monetary Policy in the 1960s
Abstract: In this lecture, Milton Friedman reviews the role of fiscal and monetary policies on the course of the U.S. business cycle, during several episodes from 1961 to 1969. He relates these developments to shifts in contemporary popular and scientific opinion about the determinants of the business cycle. In each episode of expansion or contraction, he shows that monetary policy – in the sense of changes in the rate of growth of the quantity of money – was at least as important as fiscal policy in determining the pace of economic activity and the rate of inflation, and always dominated when these policies were moving in opposite directions. During the lecture, Friedman makes several digressions to explain the variability of the lag in effect of monetary policy, the reason why interest rates are a poor guide to the stance of monetary policy, and why the downward-sloping liquidity preference function is a poor model that fails to comport with the real world. He also explains why tax increases are not necessarily contractionary, and why tax decreases are not necessarily expansionary.

Title: A quantity theory framework for thinking about monetary policy
Abstract: In August 2020, FOMC chair Jerome Powell announced a strategy for achieving an inclusive value of the FOMC’s goal of maximum employment. The strategy rests on discovering the minimal value of sustainable unemployment by running the economy above potential until the unemployment rate declines to a level that initiates an inflation overshoot from the FOMC’s longer-run 2 percent target. There is presumably no contradiction with an FOMC target for inflation of 2 percent. As indicated by the appellation “flexible-average-inflation targeting” (FAIT), the inflation overshoot would compensate for prior undershoots of the 2 percent target. The FOMC’s current framework is reminiscent of the 1970s. With a country fractured over the Vietnam War and a militant civil rights movement, a socially desirable low unemployment rate became a political imperative. FOMC chairman Arthur Burns accepted the challenge (Hetzel 1998, 2008, Ch. 8). The Keynesian consensus of the time promised to deliver a socially desirable rate of unemployment at least as low as 4 percent at the cost of only moderate inflation. This desirable Phillips curve trade-off between unemployment and inflation became the centerpiece of monetary policy. Modigliani & Papademos (1975 and 1976) provided the organizing principle for monetary policy. Namely, there is a predictable and “exploitable” trade-off in which changes in inflation depend upon the difference between the unemployment rate and a full-employment rate termed the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU). At least in 2021, however, the FOMC assumption is that there is no trade-off because the Phillips curve is assumed flat at least down to its prepandemic low of 3.5%. When persistent inflation above 2% emerges, the adjective “flexible” in FAIT becomes relevant. The FOMC will then trade off between two competing goals – 2% inflation and inclusive maximum employment.

Title: Reconciling the Nash and Kalai-Smorodinsky cooperative solutions: Generalized maximands of CES form
Abstract: This paper suggests variations to the baseline Nash cooperative solution that take into account the Kalai-Smorodinsky critique. One the one hand, a CES form of the maximand is proven to accommodate both the generalized two-person Nash and the Kalai-Smorodinsky - as other proportional - solutions as special cases. As an alternative, a Stone-Geary formulation is forwarded, weighing both the distances to the threat and to the ideal point, along with the corresponding CES generalization. Interpretations of the implied equilibrium solutions – generalizable to n-person cooperative games – are provided, arising as equations balancing geometric averages of measures of attitude towards (large) risk(s) of the players.

Title: El Salvador’s Bitcoin law is destined to be caught in the FATF’s regulatory web
Abstract: In the middle of the night of June 8th, El Salvador’s Congress hastily passed the Bitcoin Law. This law will make bitcoin legal tender (actually, forced tender). Since the modalities concerning the implementation of the Bitcoin Law change with each passing day, we cannot opine on the details surrounding the scheduled launch of the Bitcoin Law on September 7, 2021. That said, it’s abundantly clear that if the Bitcoin Law is actually implemented, El Salvadoran banks, merchants, and their customers will cross swords with Financial Action Task Force regulators and be ensnared in the FATF’s web of regulations.

Title: Will the pandemic bulge in money cause high inflation?
Abstract: The monetary aggregate M2 increased from $15,473 billion in February 2020 to $19,670 billion in February 2021, or by 27.1%. Real M2 (M2 deflated by the CPI) increased similarly by 25.3%. This monetary acceleration, unprecedented outside of wartime, is apparent in a longer-run perspective. From the trough of the last business cycle in June 2009 through February 2020, annualized monthly growth rates for M2 averaged 5.9%. Over the interval March 2020 through June 2020, they averaged 65.6%. Although diminished, rapid M2 growth continued, averaging 12.9% from July 2020 through March 2021. Milton Friedman famously said that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. If he is right, should not this bulge in money lead to an undesirably high rate of inflation? Section 1 summarizes what the Fed must do to avoid an undesirable increase in inflation. Section 2 lays out the argument in terms of a need for procedures that ensure monetary control. Section 3 describes the Fed’s new monetary policy called “flexible-average-inflation targeting” (FAIT). It highlights how radical a departure FAIT is from the policy of the Great Moderation as a consequence of making the unemployment rate an independent goal rather than using its changes as an indicator variable for whether the economy is growing unsustainably fast or slow. Section 4 draws out the parallels between FAIT and the monetary policy followed in the 1970s. It makes the argument that unless the FOMC reinstates the policy of preemptive increases in the funds rate guided by the necessity of unwinding the 2020 bulge in M2, it will inaugurate an undesirably high period of inflation. Section 5 argues that in many ways with its dismissal of money FAIT resembles modern monetary theory (MMT) adapted to exploitation of the trade-offs promised by a Phillips curve. Section 6 contends that money remains at the heart of any serious conceptual framework for discussing the powers of a central bank. An appendix provides a more formal quantity theoretic framework using the New Keynesian model.

Title: The UK prudential regulation authority’s valuation principles for equity release
Abstract: In recent years the UK Prudential Regulation Authority has been involved in an ongoing discussion with equity release firms over the principles to be used in the valuation of equity release mortgages. The UK regulator proposed a set of such principles in its Supervisory Statement SS 3/17. These principles mark a major step forward in equity release valuation methodology. They are based on elementary pricing economics, their validity is easily established and they are easy to apply. They can be used to provide a cross-check on any proposed set of valuations and so test the reliability of the underlying valuation model or its calibration.

Title: Personal income tax: Evidence from South Africa
Abstract: The purpose of this paper was to assess the nationalities of Personal Income Tax (PIT) payers. This study used critical data from three sources – the South African census (Statistics South Africa (Stats SA)), tax assessments and IRP5s (South African Revenue Service (SARS)). IRP5 is a document that is known as an employee's tax certificate which outlines the employer/employee's related incomes, taxes, and related deductions at the end of each year. Statistical Analysis System (SAS) was used to analyse the data. This study found that 3.7 million assessed taxpayers were identified as contributors of PIT in 2011. Of these PIT payers, 3,681,325 (2,091,615 males and 1,589,710 females) were born in South Africa; 71,404 (46,986 males and 24,418 females) were not born in South Africa; and 37,486 (807 males, 339 females and 36,340 unknown) could not be identified as they had no South African identity document. Data used in this study originated from the results of a survey organized by Stats SA and tax assessments supplied by SARS specifically for the period 2001. The study attempted to shed light on the national identity of taxpayers working in South Africa. For comparison purposes, tax assessment data constitutes the originality of this study, as obtaining consistent estimates of earnings mobility remains a non-trivial task in the country.

Title: Milton Friedman’s views on the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy
Abstract: This paper first traces the evolution of Milton Friedman’s views on fiscal policy from his early acceptance of the prevailing Keynesian orthodoxy to his later adoption of an entirely contrary view that fiscal policy played almost no role in macroeconomic stabilization. Until the late 1940s or early 1950s Friedman believed that fiscal policy should be the primary tool of government policy in macroeconomic stabilisation – the management of real GDP growth and inflation. However, by 1953 he had shifted to the diametrically opposite view that fiscal policy played almost no role in macroeconomic stabilisation and that as a result policymakers should rely principally on monetary policy. Second, the paper explores some of the theoretical arguments Friedman used to defend his new position. Third, the paper takes up a challenge that Friedman himself proposed to assess the relative importance of monetary and fiscal policies by comparing a series of episodes when fiscal and monetary policies were acting either in the same direction or in opposite directions. All the examples cited confirm Friedman’s finding that monetary policy invariably dominated over fiscal policy in determining macroeconomic outcomes, and particularly when the two policies were acting in contrary directions.

Title: A study on consumption behaviors of each generation in Mongolia in transition countries: Behavioral economics approach about money illusion and consumption smoothing
Abstract: In this research, the money illusion not only has arisen, but it was checked that a time preference rate is not constant. If it is consumed as the younger age group and a rate of time preference changes with generations, it will be thought that 1-dollar value changes with generations. That is, even if the loss of the same amount produces the younger age group and an old age layer, if it is the younger age group, a loss may also feel the loss by a money illusion small. That is, the time preference rate which affects consumption smoothing also affects a money illusion. The difference for every generation of a time preference rate becomes larger than the influence which only consumption smoothing has on people’s economical action. It has a possibility of bringing a big difference to the economical action for every generation. If the preference of a between at the different time changes with generations, the consumer behaviors at a certain time not only differ for every generation, but it will be thought that the reactions to a loss also differ.

Title: A balance sheet analysis of the Banque de l’Afrique Occidentale
Abstract: The Banque de l’Afrique Occidentale was a Paris-based bank that operated in French colonies in West Africa and Equatorial Africa. From 1901 to 1955 it was a monopoly note issuer and so had one characteristic of a central bank alongside its commercial banking functions. This paper briefly reviews its history during that period, which apparently has not previously been done in English; collects the main legal enactments related to the bank, never done before for the whole period of its existence as a note issuer; and analyzes its balance sheet, which has never been digitized before and is available in an accompanying spreadsheet workbook. Through the balance sheet, the paper examines the composition of the bank’s assets and liabilities and how they evolved over time. It concludes with some observations about the bank’s role in French colonial Africa.

Title: A study on incentives and behaviors of each age group in transition countries: Case for Mongolia
Abstract: This section is examined statistically whether the importance of the motives for act and the acceptances for lower wage and labor incentives is different between each age group. Above results shows young age group is “self-actualization” as important motive, old age group is “moral” as it. And old age group has higher labor incentives when it is suggested higher wage than the wage according to my ability, and when it is the lifetime employment system. Older age group think “moral” as important motive. They think that want to rewarded with the lifetime employment system and higher wage. It checked that action motives differed according to a generation. Moreover, Prospect Theory, the efficiency wage hypothesis, and the relative wage hypothesis were satisfied, and it was checked that the influences differ in his twenties as compared with other generations. Moreover, the rate of desiring lifelong employment system as a senior was large, and his twenties had many people who do not desire lifelong employment system strongly. This shows that consciousness change and a behavioral change may have arisen in that time in 1990 which shifted to the market economy bordering on people who were his teens, i.e., his present twenties, and his 30’s. It is shown that there is no big difference the results of transition country, the results of advanced nations, especially the result of Japan.

Title: Impact of reduction in corporate income tax on the South African economy: A CGE analysis
Abstract: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the drop in the Corporate Income Tax (CIT) from the current rate of 28% to 27% on the South African economy. The CGE model is considered appropriate to perform this research paper. This model is considered as the suitable model to evaluate the effects of change in CIT due to its usage over the years by the researchers and academics. One simulation is taken into consideration to evaluate the effects of the reduction in the CIT. The macroeconomic and investment closures were considered to observe the effects of the shock within the economy. In the closure, capital stock is allowed to change. Apart from the capital stock, the unskilled labour force is also allowed to change. The setting up of the CIT to 1% reduction results in a slight increase in the GDP, consumption, export and government revenue. Due to the fact that tax collection depends on the type of policy, economy and compliance revenue accomplishment, it was anticipated that private consumption should heighten as the CIT drop by 1%. In this respect, the improvement in the economy-wide productivity indicates that output has a significant impact on employment. The GDP increases slightly by 0.02164% which point out that the expansionary economy coupled with augmented export demand raises the demand for factors of production. CIT and tax assessment data constitutes the originality of this study, as acquiring reliable data on the CIT continues to be a non-trivial task in South Africa.

Title: International uncertainty shocks and central bank quantitative easing under supply shocks
Abstract: This study examines the impact of shocks to economic instability in countries with quantitative easing policies. We estimate a global VAR with time-varying parameters using Bayesian techniques (TVP-GVAR-FSVM). We estimate Nelson-Siegel, a variable related to the yield curve, and find no significant difference in the results whether it is included or not in the VAR model; as a result of the change from a primarily demand-driven shock before 2020 to a supply shock after 2020, the shock to instability is amplified. Volatility shocks were amplified. We further examined the trends in changes in interest rates, exchange rates, long- and short-term interest rate differentials, and economic instability from three perspectives: first, developing versus non-developing countries; second, resource-exporting versus non-resource-exporting countries; and third, countries like Japan, which employs yield curve control, and other countries. Daily data on exchange rates and long- and short-term interest rate differentials revealed commonalities among resource-exporting countries. The TVP-GVAR-FSVM estimation results also showed that the consumer price index has shown common movements in developing countries, especially resource-exporting countries, in recent years. The effect on the unemployment rate also showed movements specific to developed countries, but no commonalities were found among countries in other variables. Compared to resource-importing countries, resource-exporting countries’ increased profits due to higher resource prices after the war in Ukraine served as a cushion due to the instability in the global economy and weakened the negative impact on their economies. However, for developing resource-importing countries, shocks to economic stability caused significant volatility. A common feature of countries that have switched to interest rate policies is that prices have very high rates of increase. In addition, the rise in yield curve variables suppressed consumer prices and raised stock prices. Countries that experienced a sustained narrowing of the long/short interest rate differential theoretically resulted in a flattening of the yield curve but also resulted in currency appreciation.

Title: A comprehensive monetary analysis of the U.S. during COVID-19
Abstract: As a response to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve implemented one of the most expansionary monetary policies in its history, renewing asset purchases under quantitative easing and supporting the economy using a wide range of other tools. In this paper, the authors provide an overview of the changes in the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve from February 26th, 2020 to April 7th, 2021 as well as an overview of the main actions taken by the Federal Reserve over the same period. The authors then analyze the impact of the activity of the Federal Reserve on the economy from the monetary perspective. In particular, the authors examine the expansion of the balance sheet of U.S. commercial banks, analyze credit counterparts of broad money, and conduct the golden growth rate analysis for broad money supply growth. The authors conclude the paper by analyzing changes in inflation expectations and Treasury yields.

Title: Disregard of the empirical; optimism of the will: The abandonment of good government in the covid-19 crisis
Abstract: We are grateful to the editors and the publishers of the book in which this chapter appears, for that manner of that appearance is unusual. Save for the correction of slips and what it is hoped are some minor stylistic improvements, this chapter has been left as it was when it was given what the authors thought was a shape ready for publication sometime in early 2021. The central thinking of the chapter had taken shape sometime in late 2020. The wish to publish a chapter which will, then, be three years out of date when it appears would anyway require explanation, but this is a fortiori the case with a chapter on a topic so quickly and dramatically shifting as the evaluation of the UK government’s response to the outbreak of Covid in early 2020. In essence, such significance as the chapter possesses is that it shows that, at the time that what is in the chapter called ‘inchoate communism’ was generating lockdown, an immensely superior alternative was perfectly possible, had the UK government taken what can, consistent with the title of this book, be called a ‘conservative’ approach to regulation.

Title: A survey of Venezuelan public opinion on the replacement of the Bolivar with either the U.S. dollar or the central bank of Venezuela with a currency board
Abstract: This paper describes the methodology and presents the results of a Datincorp survey on Venezuela’s economic crisis. The survey was carried out in March 2017. A majority of Venezuelans do not trust the Central Bank of Venezuela, and believe that immediate change is necessary. A majority of Venezuelans also indicate that the implementation of dollarization or an orthodox currency board are not only the most desirable solutions in theory, but are also highly supported by Venezuelan public opinion.

Title: Analyzing female labor force participation in Afghanistan: Panel data approach
Abstract: In comparison to other countries, female labor force participation in Afghanistan is the lowest. Afghanistan currently has the lowest labor force participation rate in the world, at 16%. According to the 2015 UN Gender Inequality Index, women own only 5% of Afghan businesses. The aim of this paper is to examine female labor force participation in Afghanistan. This is the first study of women’s labor force participation in Afghanistan. Data were obtained from a variety of official sources, including the Central and Statistical Organization of Afghanistan, the World Bank, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Women’s Affairs. The dataset covers 20 provinces in the different time periods from 2016 to 2020. In a panel data approach, we used a fixed effects model and a generalized method of moments (GMM) to analyze the effect of minimum wage, female education, female age, mother age, household size, father’s education level, and female labor skills (work experience) on female labor force participation. Our findings show that the minimum wage, female education, female age, father’s education level, and female work skills (work experience) all have significant and positive effects on female labor force participation. However, the mother’s age has no effect on women’s labor-force participation. There is a strong, statistically significant, and negative relationship between household size and female labor force participation. These findings imply that the Afghan government should consider using minimum wages, education, working age, and work experience as policy tools to increase female labor force participation. Using a panel data approach, this study contributes to the literature in Afghanistan.

Title: Venezuela’s tragic meltdown
Abstract: Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to express my views on “Venezuela’s Tragic Meltdown.” A great deal of the commentary on the topic is polemical, and more-or-less political and ideological self-justifications of one sort or another. In consequence, the discourse is often confused and confusing. In an attempt to bring some clarity to the topic, I will focus on the one necessary condition that must be satisfied before the Venezuelan economy can be turned around. Inflation must be stopped before stability can be established. Stability might not be everything, but everything is nothing without stability.

Title: Subsistence-(Threshold) payoff and truncated risk preferences
Abstract: A measure of aversion to a risk akin to the risk premium is the required payoff truncation – a probability level, or a point of the distribution range – of the – null mean – risk distribution that allows an expected utility equal to the deterministic level. For a small risk – a noise of null expected value – added to the argument of an utility function, it is straight-forward to show that – for a risk-averse individual – such subsistence probability equals the conventional risk-premium over the symmetric of the worst possible outcome. However, both measures do not take into account aversion (or proneness) to risk in the utility distribution itself – they apply to expected utility maximizers. Maxmin behaviour and quantile preferences, applicable in the presence of uncertainty (or non-cooperative opponents) rather than risk, can be suggested to circumvent the problem. An alternative theory – constrained expected utility – relies on the use the expected utility over the upper truncated distribution (lower – or doubly truncated – in case of risk-loving behavior) at a given (individual specific) truncation point, or probability level. Then, a conventionally defined risk-premium weighs both the truncation bias and risk dispersion. Such distinction also applies if preference truncation – or rather, “trimming” – is (instead) accompanied by a switch of probability mass to tail “focal” points. Then, if the latter are sufficiently extreme, the effect on attitude towards risk may be reversed relative to standard preference truncation: lower trimming enhancing risk-aversion, upper one reducing it. Applications of truncated principles to mean-variance “utility” preferences – and risk-loving attitudes – were also briefly outlined. Illustrations for normal and uniform risks were often appended.

Title: Anomic attitudes as results of objectification of the risk among Douala-Yaounde-Bafoussam-Douala intercity carrers: A psychosocial and economic impact study
Abstract: The main characteristic of economically advanced societies is the densification of movements both within and outside different countries. People and goods' movements go hand in hand with the necessity for security. The issue of road safety revolves around the fight against road accidents. It involves combining the necessary resources to prevent traffic accidents or mitigate their consequences if they still occur. This research is based on the following central question: what is the level of impact of risk objectification on anomic attitudes regarding road safety among intercity public transport drivers in Cameroon? It examines the development of the social representation of risk among drivers to highlight the underlying mental posture that leads to deviant behaviors on the road.

Title: A mixed-method approach study in Brazil Congress: The vote on matters of high degree of technical complexity
Abstract: This article delves into the intricate relationship between legislative power, and public policy efficiency, exploring their impact on the formulation and implementation of public policies in Brazil. The study adopts a mixed-method approach, combining descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis, to shed light on this less-explored aspect of legislative functioning, investigating whether the Legislative Power in Brazil uses its competence to vote on matters of a specialized nature or delegates the rule to the Executive Power. The legislative process analyzed in this research is one of a Provisional Measure. This process is the most appropriate because it involves both houses of Congress and begins with the Executive branch enacting the rule. Descriptive statistics show correlations between key variables, while qualitative content analysis revealed a preference for the Legislative Power to regulate matters of technical nature rather than delegating them to specialized bodies. The study's findings underscore the importance of public trust in government actions, as both the Executive and Legislative branches need to prioritize transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to maintain public confidence in the regulatory process. Policymakers must carefully assess the context and objectives of each regulatory proposal to make informed decisions about delegation that best serve the public's interests and the government's effective functioning.

Title: Indian agriculture, role in the economy and economic liberalisation: Revisited
Abstract: This study focuses on the changes taking place in the agriculture sector in India, particularly since the early 1990s. A great deal of focus has been in the academic literature on growth rates in India in recent years, while the ongoing agrarian crisis is less discussed. The study intends to fill this gap and analyse the reasons behind the current crisis in the agriculture sector such as the slowing down in agricultural rates of growth, rising rural unemployment, food insecurity and rising numbers of farmers’ suicides, declining prices of agricultural commodities, and a widening gap between the agriculture and non-agriculture sectors in terms of their share to gross domestic product. The study concludes that Indian agriculture is overburdened in the sense that a very high proportion of the population is dependent on this sector, while it has low productivity and low capital investment. It seems that the agriculture sector has much greater impact on reducing poverty and improving food security than other sectors of the economy. Therefore, public investment is important as it played a positive role in the pre-reform period. Public investment in land and water management seems to be crucial for improving the agriculture sector in the long-term growth and viability in India. The study recommends that for successful inclusive growth, agricultural growth is a prerequisite, and it is important to increase the availability of institutional credits and public investments in rural infrastructure, especially to assist small and marginal farmers and to diversify the rural economy.

Title: Beware financial conditions indicators!
Abstract: This paper compares two versions of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy: the monetarist model and the widely popular Financial Conditions Index (FCI) model. The focus is on the role of interest rates and spreads as indicators of the business cycle. In the monetarist model, following a sustained upswing or downswing in the rate of growth of money, theory and evidence point to two subsequent stages for interest rates – first the liquidity effect, followed by the Fisher effect. These two movements are in opposite directions, both being effects of prior monetary growth. The first effect is typically quite brief; the latter effect usually lasts much longer. I find that the monetarist model fits the experience since March 2020 like a glove. By contrast, the FCI model generally ignores monetary growth and constructs an index consisting of a composite of rates, spreads and other financial market indicators. This index is taken as the driver for subsequent moves in asset prices, credit market developments and their impact on the real economy. To my knowledge, the FCI model is nowhere fully articulated and is only vaguely specified in mathematical terms. Based on evidence from business cycle developments since the onset of Covid for the US, the euro-area, and the UK, the FCI results are shown to be inconsistent and sometimes contradictory.

Title: Multivariate risk exposure: Risk-premium, optimal decisions and mean-variance implications
Abstract: This research develops and expands the concept of risk-premium to a multivariate environment, providing an operational framework for the analysis of mean-variance optimizers’ attitudes towards exogenous uncertainty. Firstly, it digresses over possible approximations to the risk premium. Secondly, importance and properties of the variance of the objective function are highlighted. Thirdly, impact of uncertainty on the objective function and on control variables of mean-variance agents is confronted with that of expected function optimizer’s. The analysis is also applied to ex-post flexible or adjustable environments with respect to the decision variables. Production theory examples are briefly sketched. Innovation in tools include matrix algebra results and representation of higher than second moments – with reference to the multinormal as a special case –, and implicit rules of first-order condition point-wise optimization of functions of expected value and of variance of other functions.

Title: Impact of special COVID-19 social relief of distress grants in South Africa: A CGE analysis
Abstract: This paper assesses the outcomes of the Special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress Grants (SRDG) program. A gratuity of R350 ($26.5) per person and per month was granted to low-income households following a national lockdown on 26 March 2020, aimed at alleviating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although children and elderly grants are excluded from this program, the study focuses on cash transfer programs in terms of their role in increasing current consumption of poor households and enabling them to gain capitals. We assess the general equilibrium effects of the cash transfer through the usage of a static computable general equilibrium (CGE) model calibrated to South Africa's social accounting matrix (SAM) for 2015. Our simulation results indicate that the SRDG program improved the real incomes and consumption for all households. Despite the welfare gains, South Africa’s fiscal and macroeconomic indicators suggest that the program is likely better considered as an automatic stabilizer in fiscal and social policy planning rather than as another component of social protection.

Title: COVID-19 and the outlook of the Turkish economy
Abstract: Measures including travel restrictions, temporary suspension of service sector activities and confinement at home have brought interaction between individuals and countries to almost a halt. Due to the sudden supply and demand shocks on the economy due to the implemented measures, the economic recession process has begun in the countries. The disruptions caused by the epidemic in real and financial markets have plunged countries into a large-scale and unprecedented economic crisis. Countries that were simultaneously dragged into crisis resorted to monetary policy and fiscal policy tools to combat the crisis. Support packages have been announced in Turkey, as in the world, in order to eliminate the negative conditions of the epidemic. When looking at the macroeconomic indicators before and during the epidemic, it is possible to see the damage caused by the epidemic to the country’s economies. In this study, the outlook of the country’s economy during the crisis and the policies implemented towards the crisis are examined.

Title: Explicative determinants of real exchange rate volatility in Morocco: An econometric approach
Abstract: This paper aims to present a theoretical framework regarding the determinants of Moroccan Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) volatility and to define the influential factors affecting it for the Moroccan economy between 1980 and 2020. This objective is primarily motivated by the recent changes adopted by Moroccan authorities towards a flexible exchange rate regime, which includes a progressive widening of the fluctuation range of the exchange rate. In this study, we used a GARCH(1,1) model and applied an Error Correction Model (ECM) with an estimation of the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach. We found strong evidence that, in the long run, foreign direct investments, commercial openness, and terms of trade have a statistically significant negative impact on the volatility of the Moroccan REER, while the latter has a positive influence. Additionally, external debt, public expenditure, and the applied exchange rate regime positively affect REER volatility; in other words, they contribute to increased volatility in the foreign exchange market and the Moroccan economy. Conversely, the money supply has a negative impact, and the inflation rate has a positive effect on the studied volatility; however, these last results are not statistically significant.

Title: Is American manufacturing in decline?
Abstract: There is a widespread popular view that American manufacturing is in decline. This declinist view reflects many factors. First, real GDP growth during the current business expansion has been the weakest in the post-WWII period. Second, over the decade from 2000 to 2010, manufacturing employment has declined by about 6 million. Third, persistent manufacturing trade deficits have led many observers to conclude U.S. competitiveness has eroded. This paper discusses these arguments and suggests a competing view that, instead, U.S. manufacturing is a leading growth sector and has remained strongly competitive internationally. On balance, we show that traditional domestic economic forces adequately explain recent trends in U.S. manufacturing output and employment growth. Finally, we argue that the recent reduction in the corporate income tax rate may further boost the fortunes of the U.S. manufacturing sector, although this favorable development could be offset by a more restrictive international trade regime.

Title: The postulate of the three regimes of economic growth contradicted by data
Abstract: The postulate of the three regimes of economic growth is contradicted by data. It is based on the interpretation of the historical gross domestic product (GDP) data. However, the analysis of the data shows that the interpretation is incorrect. The postulate is based on the assumption that there was a long period of stagnation followed by a sudden takeoff and then by a sustained economic growth. The analysis of the data shows that there was no stagnation, no takeoff and no three regimes of growth. The data show that the growth was hyperbolic and that it was gradually diverted to a slower trajectory. The postulate of the three regimes of growth is not supported by data and should be abandoned.
Classification-JEL: O10, O11, O40.
Keywords: Economic growth, GDP, growth regimes, hyperbolic growth, data analysis.
