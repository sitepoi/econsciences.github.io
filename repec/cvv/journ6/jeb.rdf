Title:  “External Debt, Domestic Investment and Economic Growth in Cameroon” A system Estimation Approach
Abstract:  The feedback of external debt on economic growth through gross domestic investment has provided quite interesting results throughout the world especially in developing countries where external and internal borrowing have been a tradition. Based on a system estimation approach, using Two Stage Least Squares as an estimation technique in the case of Cameroon for a period of 34 years (1980-2013), the results reveal that while domestic investment increases economic growth, external debt retards economic growth in Cameroon, revealing the influence of debt overhang. It was therefore concluded that external debts adversely affect economic growth in Cameroon and thus, as a major recommendation, the authorities are expected to improve on the performance of external debt through proper debt management, a complete debt relief and using the debt in productive sectors for production of goods and services.

Title:  Reflections of Globalization in Society Today
Abstract:  There is a growing global impoverishment. Some claim that the increasing number of street children and youth, especially observable in the world's poorest countries, was one of the consequences of globalization. The article aims to explore and provoke a reflection on globalization in developing countries. Globalization or globalization as it is referred to in recent decades is more a process of global meltdown, striking and explicit, in the fields of economy, culture and politics, the process followed by a remarkable loss of meaning of power of nation-states. The opening of markets in emerging countries has caused a profound change in the economy closing industries that could not compete globally. Question the globalization of poverty and underdevelopment caused and reinforced by the accumulation of wealth and somehow still not discovered how the people can benefit in some way.

Title:  Assessing Competition with the Panzar-Rosse Model in the Turkish Banking Sector
Abstract:  The Turkish banking sector was reformed with new regulations after 2000. The aim of this study is to measure the degree of concentration and assess the state of competition in the Turkish banking sector using data from 22 commercial banks for the period of 2002-2013. The data is analyzed using the pooled Generalized Least Square (PGLS) method. Concentration measures of CR3, CR4 and HHI are used and they show a moderate but slightly decreasing concentration in the sector. The widely accepted Panzar and Rosse (1987) model and its H-statistic are used as a non-structural method to assess the degree of competition. The H-statistic of 0.599 is found for the period of 2002-2013. It indicates a monopolistically competitive market structure for the Turkish banking sector.

Title:  Quantitative Easingand U.S. Financial Asset Returns
Abstract:  This paper is a comprehensive study of the unconventional monetary policy taken by the Federal Reserve since the financial crisis of 2008, specifically on the purchases of different assets by the Fed to change medium and long-term rates.  Included in this study are the three rounds of quantitative easing, and the two rounds of Operation Twist. A study as such is needed in order to examine if the Fed’s purchases of these various long-term assets had any effect on the financial markets in the longer term perspective since the first announcement of the first round of purchase in November 2008. While there exists a variety of literature on the effects of quantitative easing on Treasuries and mortgage backed securities, there is no single study comprising of all the large scale asset purchases by the Fed, covering their effects on all major financial assets. This study is an attempt to fill this void in current literature on quantitative easing.

Title:  Sokoto Rima River Basin Development Authority (SRRBDA) and Rural Development in Sokoto State, Nigeria
Abstract:  In spite of the efforts by successive administrations in Nigeria to address the issue of rural development, the rural areas remain backward in terms of development. This study, therefore, attempted to examine the effect of the SRRBDA on rural development in Sokoto State. The data for the study was collected by the use of questionnaire, interview, observations, as well as official records of SRRBDA, textbooks and other published and unpublished materials. The copies of the questionnaire were distributed in eight local government areas involving fifteen villages using purposive sampling and the data collected were analysed using chi-square statistical techniques in order to test the hypothesis. The revealed that the SRRBDA has not significantly enhanced rural development in the host communities through the provision of irrigation facilities and flood control. On the basis of the findings, it was recommended amongst others, that the SRRBDA should be redesigned for effective flood control and resettlement of displaced farmers.

Title:  Gorana Krstic & Friedrich Schneider (Eds), Formalizing the Shadow Economy in Serbia: Policy Measures and Growth Effects
Abstract:  Tax evasion, illicit work and social security fraud are even in Europe widely spread - especially in Eastern and Southern European Countries. Up to an additional one fourth of the official economic activities takes place in the underground. Most governments focus on fighting this deviant behaviour by punitive measures. But empirical data shows in opposition to standard economic theory that this way is expensive, inefficient, and finally unsuccessful. Governments have to change institutions (e.g. tax system) and regulations to reduce incentives for illicit work and tax evasion. An increasing burden of taxation and social security contributions is – as well as regulations and the poor quality of institutions – the driving force for the increase of the shadow economy especially in OECD-countries, as various empirical analyses have shown (e.g. Enste, 2015). For Central and Eastern European countries, multivariate analyses provide evidence for the significant influence of corruption, economic freedom, and the quality of institutions on the size of the shadow economy.

Title:  E. Shizha & L. Diallo, Africa in the Age of Globalisation: Perceptions, Misperceptions and Realities
Abstract:  This text makes interesting reading. Africa in the age of globalisation is composed of four parts, each focusing on a specific theme. Part 1 Social and institutional development has four chapters, Part 2 Technology and global partnerships also has four chapters, while Part 3 Gender, migration and settlement and Part 4 Education and globalisation in Africa have three chapters each. Altogether the book has fourteen chapters. There is a striking link between the title of the text and the chapters covered. For instance, a closer look at the book shows that all the chapters fall within the purview of the phenomenon of globalisation. The chapters were written by authors from different academic backgrounds. This is a refreshing approach in that globalisation can be viewed differently by authors from various disciplines thereby avoiding projecting a monolithic view of the social phenomenon under discussion.

Title:  A Synthesis of Empirical Research in the Sustainability of Fiscal Policy
Abstract:  In the last twenty years many developed countries have faced significant public deficits, while the ability of government authorities to deal with public deficits has been receiving rising awareness from economists and policy makers. This is an imperative topic, in provisions of economics and public policy, and it is a central subject for the EMU area; hence, they are the main motivations of this paper. Theoretically, equilibrium growth paths have to be supported by adequate fiscal policy. The risk of a default on Greek sovereign debt during the last years has worried the Euro into its first serious crisis and raised the issue of debt sustainability in Europe. There is no universally accepted definition for sustainable fiscal policy. However, economists agree that expanding public debt is not sustainable. Budget policy is constrained by the need to finance the deficit. In this paper we provide a synthesis of empirical research in the validity of the Sustainability of Fiscal Policy of the existing literature for the period 1986-2012. These studies used both time series and panel data sets and empirically examined the Sustainability of fiscal policy for a single country and for a group of countries (multi-country studies). Furthermore, there are studies using data on government expenditure at the provincial or state level. Existing studies in this topic vary in the country selection. They used data for developed, developing countries or group of both, while most of them examined developed or industrial countries. All these studies found different empirical results: support, no support or mixed results.

Title:  Economic, Ecological, and Social Valuing of the Cuniculus Paca under the Ecuadorian Model of Good Living(“Buen vivir”)
Abstract:  Departing from the current development and Ecuadorian strategy, this paper assesses the wildlife species named Cuniculus Paca as a source of bush meat for local rural communities settled along the Pacific coast. At the outset, two premises are set up: on the one hand, a distinction is made between Cuniculus Pacaas a positional good and as a relational good and, on the other hand, custom is assumed lying behind in its chasing process. Thereby, it proposes a methodology to value the aforementioned specie from both economic and ecological standpoints, but also incorporating in the later the variable Good Living (“Buen vivir”), which is measured by the level of satisfaction of the relational good that is co-produced along hunting. It is also assumed that this supplementary activity carried out by local people is largely a tradition passed on from one generation to another. The paper also calculates the abundance average relative index top lace the Cuniculus paca population in the wild. An econometric model is then specified to estimate the effect of Good Living (“Buen vivir”) on its social value of the Cuniculus Paca. Based upon the estimated results some right policies to ensure a sustainable management of such resource are brought to the fore to ensure the bush meat consumption among local peasants, in line with the Good Living (“Buen vivir”) convocation.

Title:  Does Supply-Leading Hypothesis Holds in South Africa? Evidence from ARDL Estimation Technique
Abstract:  Using ARDL bound test procedure the present study investigates whether economic growth influences financial sector development through stock market development in South Africa for the period of 2005 to 2014.The finding shows that growth of the economy enhances financial sector development through stock market medium in South Africa both in short run and long-run phenomenon. The finding confirmed the existence of Joan Robison (1952) supply leading hypothesis in the country investigated. The policy implication is that the authority in this country needs to put additional efforts in policies that will boost the overall performance of the economy considering its positive influence on financial sector development via stock market boost. Effective policies that will enhance the competitiveness of the stock market performance are essential ingredient that will boost the performance of the stock market and hence will have multiplier effect on the overall economy.

Abstract:  The objective of this study is to examine the online securities trading service in Hong Kong. The upward trend in the contribution of retail online trading to total turnover value of online brokers continued, reaching 29% in 2013/14.However, international standards of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing are set by the Financial Action Task Force. We expect that the client opening procedures (especially anti-money laundering) cannot satisfy both U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission regulators. Some online brokerages will close their business in Hong Kong.

Title:  Access to Documents in the Competition Law in the Context of Damages Actions for Breaches of European Union Rules
Abstract:  Damages claims (compensation) for breaches of Articles 101 or 102 of the Treaty (direct effect) create an important sphere of private enforcement of EU competition law. The Directive seeks to ensure the effective enforcement of the EU competition rules by optimising the interaction between the public and private enforcement of competition law and ensuring obtain full compensation by victims of infringements of the EU competition rules for the harm they suffered. However, the effectiveness of filing a civil action before the national courts depends on many factors, including in particular the extent of access to documents collected in connection with the public law. Practical implementation of these rules in the interest of economically disadvantaged individuals is far from consistency. In the article the accent has been put on the problem of access barriers victims of competition breaches to the documents collected in connection administrative action.  Does the Directive remove the fundamental barriers to access to information? To ensure effective private enforcement actions under civil law and effective public enforcement by competition authorities, both instruments are required to synergy to ensure maximum effectiveness of the competition rules. It is necessary to regulate, adequately, the way the two forms of enforcement are coordinated. The mutual interplay at Union level will also avoid divergence of applicable rules, which could jeopardise the proper functioning of the EU internal market.

Title:  Foreign Loans and Development in the Twentieth Century India: An Over View of Conceptual Issues and Implications
Abstract:  The flow of foreign loans occupies a critical position in the economic development of the developing and under developed countries. Some writers view it in terms of the “dependency theory”, which states that foreign economic assistance is a tool through which the “center” exploits the “periphery” and so, the latter continues to remain undeveloped. Here, the center is donor and the periphery is the capital-receiving country. Less income levels, resources, inherited poverty, lack of good governance, political instability are some of the reasons for countries to inter into the trap of foreign loans. The article explains various definitions of foreign loans, its varieties and features. It examines into the needs which compels the countries go for foreign loans and also the donors, their characteristics and nature. Further it looks into the implications of foreign loan on the economy, social sector, agriculture, environment and politics of a country.

Title:  Growth of the World Population in the Past 12,000 Years and Its Link to the Economic Growth
Abstract:  Data describing the growth of the world population in the past 12,000 yearsare analysed. It is shown that,if unchecked, population does not increase exponentially but hyperbolically. This analysis reveals three approximately-determined episodes of hyperbolic growth: 10,000-500 BC, AD 500-1200 and AD 1400-1950, representing a total of about 89% of the past 12,000 years. It also reveals three demographic transitions: 500 BC-AD 500, AD 1200-1400 and AD 1950-present, representing the remaining 11% of the past 12,000 years. The first two transitions were between sustained hyperbolic trajectories. The current transition is to an unknown trajectory. There was never any form of dramatic transition from stagnation to growth, described often as a takeoff, because there was no stagnation in the growth of the world population. Correct understanding of the historical growth of human population is essential in the correct interpretation of the historical growth of income per capita.

While reaching information is considered to be the most important skill both for companies and people, the tool used in reaching and storage of information is technology. The development of the technologic developments in the world without slowing down, affects the service industry as well as all the other industries. Health institutions that have a great share in service industries have to follow the innovations and technological developments closely in order to survive in competitive market conditions and therefore they should make their plans in in accordance with these developments. In accordance with these statements, the aim of the study is; to search whether the information technology investments of health institutions in order to ensure customer satisfaction and sustainability correspond to the future plans or not. For that purpose, health institutions located in cities Gümüþhane and Trabzon in Eastern Black Sea Region, constitute the universe of the research. The data of the universe is obtained by survey data acquisition technique. Reliability and validation analyses were applied with definitional statistical analyses to the data obtained and the optimal scale structure for the structural model is attained. Goal oriented structural model is analyzed with structural equation model and AMOS 20 and SPSS 20 package programs. In accordance with the factors obtained as a result of the research it is stated that; factors such as information structures of the health institutions, information technology usage levels of the health institutions, information technology perceptions of the health institutions, the usage level of health institutions during decision making processes and technology compliance of health institutions are effective on the future plans of the health institutions.

Title:  The Administered Public Recreation Marketing Concept
Abstract:  The article focuses on four major assumptions that underlie the alternative conceptualization of public recreation marketing. It explains (1) the redistribution system within recreation resources are allocated; (2) the organizational structure of recreation agencies; (3) the ways in which public recreation agencies interact with local governments and citizens; and (4) the code of ethics and its influence on the behavior of recreation professionals. Finally, the article attempts to integrate these assumptions into an alternative definition of public recreation marketing that is termed “administered marketing.”

Title:  Unified Money Circulation Equation and an Analogical Explanation for Its Solvability
Abstract:  The equation of exchange is well-known as a quantitative expression of money circulation, but it has a defect in that the relation between the velocity of money and the situation of economic agents is not clear. This paper attempts to found the velocity which pays attention to movement of money. For that purpose, this paper shows a money circulation equation in which agents of the whole society are unified. If this equation has a unique solution, the velocity of money is reduced to the expenditure rate of the whole society. Thereby, the defect of the equation of exchange can be remedied. Our attempt can be interpreted as connecting the velocity of money with the multiplier analysis. Success or failure of the trial depends on its solvability. This solvability problem of the money circulation equation is closely related to the missing problems of the monetary budget constraint. This paper also attempts to explain the missing problems in the case of the budget constraint of the whole society. This paper explains that a time irreversible disposal solves those problems by using an analogy.

Title:  Effect of Smoking and other Economic Variables on Wages in the Euro Area.
Abstract:  The smoking effects on wages has been examined in this work using different econometric methodologies with the use of European Community Household Panel (ECHP) datasets. We employ econometric tools like Instrumental Variable technique, Heckman correction factor, Endogenous Switching and matching estimates. The initial results from regression estimates (OLS and IV methods) revealed that the wage gap between smokers and non-smokers ranges 1% to 22.7%. Moreover, endogenous switching and matching estimator also showed a negative average treatment effect of approximately 47% and 4.3% to 6.9% respectively. Thus smokers observed less wage effects is explained in part by real effects on their health status and a measure of unobserved preferences.

Title:  Innovation, Cooperation Network and Economic Growth, a Tunisian Case
Abstract:  In this paper we investigate postulations on the relation between innovation activities andeconomic factors of growth. The old explication of innovation are limited to the notion of technological progress. Generally, technological progress deals about the number of patent and its impact on nation growth and firm modernity, in this case innovationsactions are considered as an improvements activities. However, there is a new way to analyze innovation, itdoesn’t limit itself to the number of patents or a new technological products but it also deals with improvements in production process, organization, finance and distribution. Thisstudy analyze the determinant of innovations on a macroeconomic and microeconomic level. In this paper, we see the important role of innovation system, government rolecooperation network and human resources capacity in improving Tunisian firmgrowth.

Title:  Analyzing Economic Growth: What Role for Public Investment?
Abstract:  This paper discusses the role of public investment in the determination of output growth from different theoretical and empirical points of view. The light is shed on the factors that allegedly explain the success and/or the failure of public investment policies in enhancing productivity and supporting GDP, based on a review of empirical evidence in advanced and developing economies. The downstream objective is to provide decision makers with a set of general rules-of-thumb that are likely to help them improve the macroeconomic returns of public investment. The latter are found to be significantly influenced by efficiency and profitability-based selectivity of investment projects. Countries with a relatively low capital-labor ratio usually have higher public and private capital profitability, while the public-private investment substitutability increases the likelihood of crowding out effects. The paper also gives hints on the possible existence of an optimal growth-maximizing level of public investment.

Title:  Impact of Corporate Governance on Diversification in Finance Companies: Evidence from Malaysia
Abstract:  The board of directors performs a very important role in formulating and monitoring the strategy of a company. Recent development in technology and the change in business environment as well as change in the nature of demand by customers has necessitated the change in the products and services offered by finance companies. Based on data from finance companies listed on Bursa Malaysia over the period 2007 to 2011 this paper examined the impact of board attributes and ownership structure on the corporate strategy of finance companies in Malaysia. The result indicates that expertise of directors and past performance is significant and negatively related with diversification. The study contributes to the literature on corporate governance of finance companies in relation to their diversification strategy and has highlighted the corporate governance mechanisms and regulatory measures appropriate for the sector in order to enhance monitoring so as to achieve sustainable economic development.

Title:  Effective Cost of Borrowing from Microfinance Institutions
Abstract:  It has been observed lately that the dependence on moneylenders for borrowing needs of poor borrowers remained stable despite the presence of MFIs, particularly in developing economies. This is surprising given the fact that MFIs charge relatively lower interest rate as compared to moneylenders. The paper explains this trend by arguing that the effective cost of borrowing from MFI is higher relative to the effective cost of borrowing from moneylender. It is due to the additional burden incurred in the form of transaction costs in case of MFI borrowing. Simulation results also support this phenomenon.

Title:  An Experimental Research on Closed Loop Supply Chain Management with Internet of Things
Abstract:  Closed loop supply chain (CLSC) optimization is integration of forward and reverse logistics activities. The importance of CLSC management is increasing by legal regulations, limited energy resources and environmental- financial problems that growing in recent years. However, reverse logistics part of the CLSC is a flow type which is more difficult to made predictions, planning and controls by reason contained uncertainties. This stage, Internet of Things system reduces related uncertainties by providing all the life information of the returned product and substantially attenuates planning of reverse flow activities. In this study, a CLSC is considered that meets demands of the sales&collection center both new and remanufactured product. Manufacturer has three options (refurbishing, disassembly and disposal) to assessing returned products. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed for a single type of product is completely modular (automobile, computer, telephone, etc.). The model meets customer's products and components demands based period, maximizes profit consist of different sales revenues and total cost (total production, purchase, transportation and disposal costs) and determines how to evaluate all returned products. The proposed model has been verified with the aid of a numerical example by solving in GAMS software and its performance reviewed with experimental studies.

Title:  Evaluating Current Logistics Facilities with Analytical Hyepapchy Process (AHP) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS)
Abstract:  Logistics facilities which have important position within logistics supply chain are established in order for the demanded goods to be supplied on time, with the minimum cost and in the shortest duration. Given the cost and time factors, the location of such facilities should be selected very carefully and effectively. Especially, a quick settlement in logistics manner is experienced depending on transportation network, work force, proximity to market and raw materials of the times following the industrialization period after establishing the Republic. Nowadays, with the development of transportation and the communication systems as well as technology transportation costs decreased and the facilities and possibilities transport from one place to another increased. For this reason, like the private sector the public institutions and organizations began to shrink, shut down or merge their facilities. This situation was brought to reconsider the existing facilities. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and analyze current six logistics facilities with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Analyses results will contribute the decision of revising logistics facilities for which are planned to be restructured. Moreover, suggestions are presented for proper ones to continue operating, for improper ones to get closed or transferred to another place.

Title:  An Application Related to Logistics Social Responsibility Evaluation with DEMATEL and ELECTRE Methods
Abstract:  The issue of environment becomes one of the privileged areas determined in the framework of social responsibility when national and international ethical scandals are experienced in various sectors. Therefore, to analyze activities of logistics firms in the framework of social responsibility theme gains importance while evaluating the activities in terms of their environmental effects. In regard to this important aspect, the purpose of this study is determined as to specify and prioritize the criteria which logistics firms should take into account while performing their social responsibility activities then to select the logistics firm which has the highest level of social responsibility. In this manner, DEMATEL method is used for weighting the criteria and ELECTRE method is used for firm selection. Analysis results show that “breakdown of fleet composition” criteria is the most important logistics social responsibility criteria while C firm has the highest level of social responsibility.

Title:  Multiple Criteria Inventory Classification for Storage Assignment and a Case Study
Abstract:  Warehouse management has been turned into a more complicated issue depending on dynamics pertain to customer, good, speed and cost. It’s an inefficient and difficult approach to control all the stored items at the same level. Based on these; the main purpose of this study is bringing in a policy for warehouse management with the help of ABC Analysis via submitting the goods to inventory based classification. The goods will be assigned to slots according to their distances to the I/O point (Input/output point) by considering their importance orders at the end. In this context, DEMATEL method is utilized besides the Multi Criteria ABC Analysis methods used in literature. Initially Multi Criteria Decision Making techniques with weighted linear optimization, and in the following in order to make these calculations more accurate, calculation of cross evaluation of goods has been made in the literature. However, when we consider the calculation of cases which has increased numbers of goods, classification will be pretty hard. Thence, only cross evaluation points of goodsexceeding a threshold value when we apply DEMATEL method are calculated and applied to classification. On a model warehouse, mentioned techniques are benchmarked and it is shown that the approach, which is offered by us, reached similar or better results than the approaches in the literature in less time.

Title:  A Decision Support Model Suggestion for Logistics Support Unit in Risky Environment
Abstract:  Storage facilities have an important role for uninterrupted product/service flow and ensuring continuity in supply chains. Criteria, which will be taken into account for the location of this facilities, and criteria values, can alter in accordance with private or public sector and risk environment as well. Besides logistics costs, transportation opportunities and proximity to the customers, risk based criteria such as terror, sabotage, air strikes, and natural disasters play an important role in order to select facility location. During production flow, Logistics Support Bases (LSB) are the military facilities, which affect firstly operation process positively or negatively and secondly result of the operations, serve in the risk environment. In a specific environment, selection of LSB becomes a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem for the decision maker. This study aims to determine qualifications which will be used to select the best suitable location of LSB; define the importance value of selected qualifications via DEMATEL method, and select the best location of LSB between alternative places. DEMATEL has used in the determination of criteria values and then VIKOR method has used to select the most appropriate location for LSB in the risk environment.

Title:  Hazardous Materials Warehouse Selection as a Multiple Criteria Decision making Problem
Abstract:  Radioactive, toxic, smother, flammable, and explosive materials in solid, liquid or gas states which can negatively impact goods, organisms, and most importantly humans are called as “Hazardous Materials”. Hazardous material transportation and storage carry risk factors in addition to their other types of transportation operations. Furthermore, selection of a suitable warehouse becomes a problematic issue in which multiple criteria are evaluated as paying attention to risky circumstances. In this context, hazardous material warehouse selection is considered as a multiple criteria decision problem in our study. In particularly, for the explosives storage among other hazardous materials, necessary criteria are determined according to expert’s consultant. The determined criteria are weighted according to decision makers’ consultancy and the alternatives are evaluated by fuzzy MULTIMOORA under uncertainty throughout the decision making process in the study.. The proposed approach is discussed on a case study.

Title:  After the Financial Crisis: Reforms and Reform Options for Finance, Regulation and Institutional Structure
Abstract:  The finance dominated type of capitalism that has developed from the late 1970s and early 1980s on finds its nucleus in the deregulation of the national and international financial system and the switch to a shareholder oriented corporate governance system. Other aspects such as labour market deregulations (including policies to weaken trade unions), the aim of completely free trade around the globe, increasing freedom and power of multinational companies, and privatisation of formerly state functions also belong to the new regime. This finance dominated economic regime seems to be exhausted. The reforms implemented after the subprime crisis and the Great Recession are not sufficient to overcome the deeply rooted problems of the existing system. Reforms to the financial system did not substantially affect the functioning of the shadow banking system and the basic structures of the financial system were not changed. Both, the international financial system as well as the shareholder oriented corporate governance system werelargely spared from reforms. Further labour market deregulations are still on the agenda of governments and international institutions. Policies to change income and wealth distribution are not on the political agenda. What is needed is a comprehensive reform agenda which searches for a new relationship between institutions, government policies, and markets.

Title:  Financial Stress Indicator Variables and Monetary Policy in South Africa
Abstract:  This paper analyses the relationship between financial stress indicator variables and monetary policy in South Africa with emphasis on how robust these variables are related to the monetary policy interest rate. The financial stress indicator variables comprise a set of variables from the main segments of the South African financial market that include the bond and equity securities markets, the commodity market and the exchange rate market.The empirical results show that the set of financial stress indicator variables from the bond and equity securities markets as well as those from credit markets and property markets are robustly associated with the monetary policy interest rate, while the set of financial stress indicator variables from commodity markets and the exchange rate market are weakly associated with the monetary policy interest rate.

Title:  Taxpayers Subsidise Private Money Creation
Abstract:  Publicly created money, i.e. base money, costs much less to produce than privately created money because amongst other things private banks have to check up on the credit worthiness of borrowers before supplying them with money.  In contrast governments do not need to do those checks when creating and spending base money into the economy. It might be claimed that the cost of private money creation is the cost of organising loans and hence that the cost of private money creation as such is not particularly high. That claim does not stand inspection. Despite the high cost of private money, it nevertheless manages to drive public money to near extinction (except in the current very low interest scenario). Reason is that private banks can create and lend out money at below the going rate of interest because they are not burdened with one of the main costs normally involved in lending, namely earning money and abstaining from consumption (so that borrowers can consume.) When an economy is at capacity, the result of that extra lending is inflationary, so government has to withdraw base money from the economy, i.e. rob taxpayers,  in order to counteract the inflation, for example by cutting the deficit / raising the surplus or by raising interest rates. In short, private money printing is subsidised by taxpayers, and subsidies reduce GDP, unless there is a good reason for a subsidy. The net result of letting private money displace base money is an artificially low rate of interest and an artificially high level of debt, plus GDP is reduced. Thus GDP would be increased if privately issued money was banned, though its complete elimination is not necessary.

Title:  Emisssion and Energy: A Catch 22
Abstract:  The COP21 process targets decarbonisation in three steps during the 21rst century.  First the augmentation of CO2:s is to be halted. Next the 40 per cent reduction is to be implemented somehow until 2030. Finally, there is a hope for a carbon free economy at the end of this century. But how about energy? When we speak about the anthropocentric emissions of greenhouse gases, then we are in reality referring to the production and consumption of energy. Energy in a wide sense is vital for the operations of social systems, as energy is the capacity to do work. Without energy, no economic output or GDP. The COP21 Agreement calls for an energy revolution during this century, replacing traditional renewables and fossil fuels with modern renewables that are carbon free. But how could this be achieved in the many poor countries in the world?

Title:  Graphic Explanation for Welfare Economic Foundation of Hoarding Loss
Abstract:  Saving brings an economic loss. The author intends to publish a paper, which gives a foundation of this paradox of thrift by connecting money circulation analysis and welfare economics in the case where saving is limited to hoarding. As an introduction of the intended paper, this paper provides a simple explanation for hoarding loss using some graphs. Under certain conditions, the representative agent hoards money in order to increase utility, but the hoarding actually decreases it against agent’s rational intention. This irrationality of rationality occurs because the agent maximizes their utility while lowering the budget of the entire relevant term. This conclusion is derived from the agent making the decision with an ignorance of the whole expenditure reflux. Since the interest of a selfish agent is limited to their private range, the agent ignores the reflux despite of its objective truthfulness.

Title:  A Preliminary Model of Regulating Natural Capital Funds for Renewable Energy
Abstract:  Framing sustainable environmental laws in regulating Natural Capital funds for Renewable Energy (RE) is central to the discussion on sustainability strategies. Natural Capital is that limited form of capital assets or service (tangible or intangible) that satisfies basic and social conditions for human existence and protection. This paper proposes an analytical regulatory model utilizing Neural Network (NN) of substantive and procedural issues framing the regulatory parameters associated with Natural capital funding. The model recognizes the fact that the purpose of any legal system is not only to assign duties and responsibilities in protecting rights of individuals and groups in their respective endeavors; but for effective modelling of natural structures as well. Through a preliminarydiscussion of European and USA markets’; regulatory systems with a focus on market and social values, it attempts to discern a practical model to formulate social and regulatory measures on financial structures and energy matters that are considered rights and obligations of individuals and organizations in conducting their businesses. As it has been a subject of academic, government, and public discussions with intense controversies, finding the differences of methodological, and analytical foundation will most probably lead to deeper insight into regulating funds for renewable energy.

Title:  On Monetary Policy, Unemployment, and Economic Growth
Abstract:  Recognizing the possible relation between investments, economic growth and unemployment, and how there is not an established impact of an unlikely productive project failure on the secondly mentioned variables, we address such relation and asses theoretically the effect of different instruments of monetary policy on the mentioned macroeconomic indicators. To do this we build upon two models of economic growth considering the role of entrepreneurs, risk takers, and a monetary authority which is the average agent of the economy that is assumed to be aware of how the inflation can damage equally the individuals' life style, independently of their particular levels of income, finding that the impact of the monetary instruments depends on the behavior of the population, and endogenizing the money in circulation.

Title:  Risks and Risk Management in Agri-food Chains
Abstract:  Risks management studies in the agri-food sector predominately focus on the technical methods and the capability to perceive, prevent, mitigate, and recover from diverse risks. In most economic publications the risks are usually studied as another commodity regulated by the market supply and demand, and the farmers “willingness to pay” for an insurance contract modeled. At the same time, the risk management analysis largely ignore a significant “human nature” based (bounded rationality, opportunism) risk, critical factors for the managerial choice such as the institutional environment and the transaction costs, and diversity of alternative (market, private, collective, public, hybrid) modes of risk management. This paper incorporates the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics and presents a comprehensive framework for analyzing the risk management in the agri-food sector. First, it specifies the diverse (natural, technical, behavioral, economic, policy etc.) type of agri-food risks, and the market, private, public and hybrid modes of their management. Second, it defines the efficiency of risk management and identifies (personal, institutional, dimensional, technological, natural) factors of governance choice. Third, it presents stages in the analysis of risk management and for the improvement of public intervention in the risk governance. Forth, it identifies the contemporary opportunities and challenges for the risk governance in the agri-food chain. Finally, it identifies challenges, assesses efficiency, and present responses of the agri-food risk management after the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan in March 2011.

Title:  Martin Qaim, Genetically Modified Crops and Agricultural Development
Abstract:  Qaim is a leading academic researcher on the global impacts of genetically modified crops and his diligence and thoroughness abound in his newest book, Genetically Modified Crops and Agricultural Development. Qaim’s objective is to inform the reader about the contribution that GM crops have, and can, make to improving economic circumstances and contribute to increased food security, particularly in developing countries. He accomplishes this objective through an artful blending of storytelling and scientific fact, allowing the reader to come away with a new appreciation for the technology and its impacts. The book provides an in depth review of the commercialization of GM cotton in India, informing readers about the extent and degree of benefits that have resulted over the past decade. This book should be required reading for those involved with organizations that actively campaign and protest against GM crops. Perhaps if those opposed gained the insights presented by Qaim, the European acceptance of a beneficial agricultural technology would begin to improve.

Title:  An Investment Initiative for Fiscally Constrained EU Member States – The Role of Synergetic Financial Instruments
Abstract:  The economy of the European Union has not recovered from the impact of the economic and financial crisis. Growth rates remain low and investment activity is weak. This questions current economic policies of the Economic and Monetary Union, known as austerity. In opposition to fiscal contraction measures, expansive fiscal action policies are often called for to initiate economic recovery. But the national interests of austerity’s main proponent, performed in an asymmetric intergovernmental bargaining arena, render most of the proposed expansive action plans impossible and hence austerity is expected to prevail. The Juncker-Plan constitutes an expansive action plan which respects the restrictive budgetary rules. Nevertheless an investment volume of 315 billion Euro should be made available, enabled by 21 billion Euro of public money. The budget contribution should lever private funds by a multiplier of 15. The crucial factor of 15 rests on experience with Synergetic Financial Instruments which have been increasingly executed during the last budget period. This work assesses the impact of expansive public investment conducted through these Synergetic Financial Instruments and thus gathers information to undertake an appraisal of the Juncker-Plan, foremost of its crucial mechanisms and resulting numbers. By this, the potential of financial instruments as means of fiscal policy and the validity of the Juncker-Plan can be assessed.

Title:  The dichotomy of Malthusian positive checks: Destruction and even more intensified regeneration
Abstract:  Impacts of Malthusian positive checks are investigated using data compiled by the United Nations Development Program. We show how the intensity of Malthusian positive checks are correlated with indicators describing the standard of living such as ecological footprint, income per capita, severe poverty, access to pure water and access to sanitation facilities. We then show that mortality increases exponentially with the intensity of Malthusian positive checks (adult mortality, under-five mortality, maternal mortality and deaths by polluted water). However, total fertility rate also increases exponentially. The surprising result of our analysis is that the growth rate and the rate of natural increase are directly proportional to the intensity of Malthusian positive checks. The regenerating impacts triggered by Malthusian positive checks do not just keep the growth undisturbed – they stimulate growth and make it even faster. Using data for Africa, we show that while the death rate increases with the intensity of hunger, total fertility rate, birth rate and the rate of natural increase also increase. Records from China also show that Malthusian positive checks of wars and famines triggered the intensified growth of population. Thus, contrary to the generally promoted interpretations, hunger and famines do not necessarily suppress the growth of population. Similar patterns of stress-induced growth are also observed in nature. This study is closely related to the problem of controlling the growth of human population.

Title:  A Regime Switching Explanation of the Reactions of Market Participant during the Crisis
Abstract:  Empirical evidence suggest that markets are too volatile to be efficient, essentially this means the influencing factor in the pricing of assets is the reaction of market participants to the information or events, rather than the actual information. Hence in order to understand the pricing of assets, there is a need to include the behavioural finance theory. An influencing observation during the recent financial and sovereign debt crises as well as the pre-crisis period is that market participants seem to be reacting to the general financial environment. We use the SWARCH model of Cai (1994) to analyse the reaction of market participants in six key sovereign debt markets (i.e. US, German, Greek, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese) in a fast changing and highly volatile environment. In general, the evidence seems to be pointing at a change in the reaction of the market participants reflecting the underlying fast changing and highly volatile environment.

Title:  Tracing the Emergence of Broadening Marketing Proposition: A Thorny Path
Abstract:  The broadening marketing concept was introduced in 1969 and was initially well-received by marketing scholars. However, during the subsequent four decades, the concept has been increasingly questioned and has divided marketing scholars in to two opposing camps. This paper traces the evolution of the broadening marketing proposition and critically examines the arguments put forward against the broadening proposition.

Title:  South African Exchange Rate After 2000s: An Econometric Investigation
Abstract:  This paper is an econometric investigation, an analysis on the difficulty of modeling the South African exchange rate. The aim of the paper is to examine the nature of the existing relationship between the real exchange rate of the Rand, real prices of gold, platinum and the real interest rate differential through different empirical models, and this over the period going from January 2000 to September 2014. Our analysis shows that, over the same period, with different empirical methods, the variables used can be the determinants ofthe real value of the South African Rand, but at different horizons. To achieve our goals, longrun (Engle & Granger, 1987; Johansen, 1988) and short run (VAR process; Sims, 1980) analysis have been performed. We come to the conclusion that, the determinants of the Rand change according to the methods used and these do not therefore allow us to have robustresults. The long run analysis performed by Engle and Granger approach result to a lack of long run relationship among our variables. To have a robust idea on the lack of cointegrating relationship, we have performed another long run analysis: the vector error correction model (VECM approach) of Johansen which results on the existence of one cointegrating relation among real value of the Rand and their determinants. However, because of the lack of long run relationship resulting of the Engle & Granger approach, we have performed a short run analysis with the vector autoregressive process. We find that only the real platinum price in our study is a short term determinant of the real value of the Rand. The real impact is effective only at the end of the first quarter with a real appreciation of the Rand. The main surprise is the absence of impact of real price of gold shock on the real value of the Rand. Analyze the South African exchange rate through one empirical method/model to find their determinants can bebiased.

Title:  On Behavioral Macroeconomics, Globalization, and Economic Growth
Abstract:  We assess theoretically the effect of forming a free trade union on the total production of a nation, where such effects are caused by the absorption of technologies through different channels. A popular metaphor describes the people as crabs in a bucket because when one crab tries to scape, the others pull it down avoiding a possible way out for all of them. Given this knowledge, posteriorly and independently of the income inequality levels, we extend our analyses to consider the effect of envy in a macroeconomic level on the total production, and draw the implications which this phenomenon has on the formation of free trade unions. We make strategic policy recommendations to allow the achievement of a globalization that benefits each member nation, where we show that the great trade union might have to start in certain order, with gradual and charitable subregional agreements, seasoned with education promotion and possibly a non restricted ideas employment.

Title:  Nonlinear Trend and Purchasing Power Parity
Abstract:  After the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the evidence on the purchasing power parity (PPP) in the long run is still a matter of debate. The difficulties of the problem are the possible nonstationarity of relative price indices and nominal exchange rates. The traditional ways to deal with nonstationarity such as unit root model and cointegration have some problems. In this paper, to deal with nonstationarity, we apply the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) trend-cycle filter in real business cycle literature (Hodrick and Prescott, 1981) which can give a nonlinear smooth-trend, and we find that after the 1970s float, the monthly HP trends of US dollar/UK sterling and Deutsche marks/US dollar have certain relevance with their corresponding HP trends of relative consumer price indices. This result indicates that there is no strong evidence to directly deny that the PPP is valid in the long run. In this sense, it is not reliable to directly deny the belief of monetary neutrality.

Title:  Shapley Value Regression and the Resolution of Multicollinearity
Abstract:  Multicollinearity in empirical data violates the assumption of independence among the regressors in a linear regression model that often leads to failure in rejecting a false null hypothesis. It also may assign wrong sign to coefficients. Shapley value regression is perhaps the best methods to combat this problem. The present paper simplifies the algorithm of Shapley value decomposition of R2 and develops a Fortran computer program that executes it. It also retrieve regression coefficients from the Shapley value. However, Shapley value regression becomes increasingly impracticable as the number of regressor variables exceeds 10, although, in practice, a good regression model may not have more than ten regressors.

Title:  Parthasarathi Shome, The G20 Development Agenda: An Indian Perspective
Abstract:  In the aftermath of the global economic crisis during 2008-09, the group of 20 nations (G20) came together to implement a series of macro-economic and financial sector reforms to bring the world economy back on the path of stability. India, given its growing GDP and increased external sector orientation, became a crucial part of the group. Once the recovery process started since 2010, G20 moved on to adopt a series of development agendas, including provisions on food security, infrastructural augmentation, energy and environmental sustainability and so on. Given India’s unique position that allows coexistence of economic growth with livelihood challenges and considerations over environmental degradation, the new G20 development agendasmay significantly influence the country’sfuture policy choice and growth path. In this context, the recent volume edited by Shome is a well-structured and timely contribution to the literature, which analyses the G20 development agendas from an Indian perspective.

Title:  The Ranking of Researchers by Publications and Citations: Using RePEc Data
Abstract:  Researcher-level metrics assess a researcher’s publications and number of citations for each publication. This paper tests empirically 28 two-variable metrics, 26 of which are new in this paper, determined as geometric means from eight one-variable metrics. The 54 highest ranked researchers in RePEc are considered, 13 of whom are Nobel prize winners. One new one-variable metric, the number of citations for the 10th most cited publication, is introduced. Characteristics of the eight one-variable metrics are considered, illustrating why two-variable metrics are needed. The 54 researchers are ranked for all 36 metrics. The lowest sum of ranks for the 13 Nobel prize winners occurs for metric , the number of citations for the highest cited publication. The 13 Nobel prize winners have on average 5.3 higher rank on  than on , suggesting a need for being widely cited, not captured by the  -index. The metric , the square root of the product of the number of publications and the citation count, proposed as an interesting metric, correlates best with the RePEc scores. Correlations between the 36 metrics are determined. The 28 two-variable metrics are tentatively ranked according to how they capture characteristics apparently not captured by the one-variable metrics.

Title:  Revisiting Determinants of Money Demand Function in Pakistan
Abstract:  This study investigates the factors such as interest rate, GDP per capita, exchange rate, fiscal deficit, urban and rural population to determine money demand function for Pakistan over the period from 1972-2013. We use ARDL Bound Testing approach in order to test long run relation between money demand and its factors whereas both long and short run coefficients will be found using similar approach. The results show that real interest rate exerts significant and negative effect upon money demand in both long and short run in Pakistan. The results also disclose that exchange rate and rural population are leaving significant but negative effect on the demand for money. These findings are robust to different diagnostic tests.

Title:  Economic Inequality as a Statistical Outcome
Abstract:  We argue that the economic inequality which is found in the OECD countries and in the salaries of the top executives’ in the Fortune 100 companies are merely an equilibrium statistical outcome, similar to that of the energy distribution among photons in a blackbody. When we treat the photons as people, the radiation modes asocial rank and the photons’ energy as wealth; we obtain for the energy distribution among photons: the Gini index, the ratio between rich and poor, the relative poverty, the part of the property held by the upper percentiles, the salaries of CEO's, very similar values to the corresponding numbers of the OECD counties and Fortune 100 companies.

Title:  Industrial Revolution did not Boost Economic Growth and the Growth of Population even in the United Kingdom
Abstract:  Data describing economic growth and the growth of human population in the United Kingdom are analysed. Contrary to the widely accepted interpretations, Industrial Revolution had no impact on shaping trajectories of economic growth and of the growth of population. Within the range of analysable data, there was also no Malthusian stagnation. Consequently, there was no escape from Malthusian trap because there was no trap in the economic growth and in the growth of human population. The United Kingdom was the centre of the Industrial Revolution and yet its data are in the direct contradiction of the currently accepted interpretations. It is fortunate that natural processes did not comply with our fanciful and wished-for explanations of the mechanism of growth. If they did, if the generally claimed takeoffs did occur, it would have been a disaster because economic growth and the growth of population would have been already unmanageable everywhere.

Title:  Toward Development of a New Health Economic Evaluation Definition
Abstract:  Economic evaluation (EE) is a dynamically advancing knowledge area of health economics. It has been conceived to provide evidence for allocating scarce resources to gain the best value for money. The problem of efficiency of investments becomes even more crucial with advances in modern medicine and public health which bring about both improved patient outcomes and higher costs. Despite the abundance of literature on the EE concepts, some key notions including the definition of the health economic evaluation remain open for discussion. Academic literature offers a large number and growing variety of EE definitions. It testifies to the fact that existing definitions do not meet economists’ requirements. The aim of this study was to examineexisting definitions and reveal their common features.

Title:  Towards a Democratization of Knowledge with Topological Emphasis in Economics
Abstract:  We formulate and prove a theorem which consists in how the natural endogenous antagonist interaction of agents who look for understanding a generalizable phenomenon, results in a tendency towards chaos. This takes us to the final absolution of implementing the majority rule as the only instrument that generates socially acceptable knowledge, escaping from the chaos tendency. Finally, we extend our analysis to consider the arise of multiple simultaneous antagonist postures on the explanation of a phenomenon, and through an application of the Pythagoras theorem, we prove that it takes less effort or sacrifice for an agent to learn strategically to get an explanation, than if she was the creator of the concerning knowledge, which implies different consequences of possible topological private and public tendencies.

Title:  Examination of the Macroeconomic Variables affecting Credit Default Swaps
Abstract:  Many investors, money authority and reputable institutions closely follow credit default swaps while they regard them as reliable tool of measuring country credibility, since credit default swaps (CDS) come into prominence as an important indicator for country risks in recent years. Therefore, this phenomenon creates itself an area in academics, and examination of countries’ default spreads and determining the macroeconomic variables affecting them become an important academic area.  For these reasons, there are lots of researches have been made in this subject in Turkey and world recently. In this research, the macroeconomic variables, which affect country default swaps of developing countries, including Turkey, are determined and examined; moreover, the effects of chosen macroeconomic variables on country default swaps are analyzed. The subject of the research is not a static case, thus Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator method from dynamic panel data methods and Residual Linear Regression Model are used. According to the results of the analyses, it is found out that the selected variables which are (i) increase in current account balance, (ii) real interest rates, (iii) GDP growth rates, (iv) inflation rates and (v) annual positive changes in S&P Global Reit Index have important effects on CDS spreads.

Title:  Unions and Wage Determination: Can Monopsonist Unions Reduce Unemployment?
Abstract:  This paper extends the standard closed shop union model of wage determination by introducing endogeneity of union membership. The labor market outcome with endogenous membership may differ when unions behave monopsonisticaly relative to the case where they are "membership-takers", resulting in higher or lower wages (more or less favorable contract curve in efficient bargaining) according to the form union´s utility function and/or implicit decision process value union size. Some notes are added highlighting the role of membership fees in the membership function determination of a union that works as a nonprofit organization.

Title:  Relationship of Fiscal Discipline and Household Income on Money Demand Function in Sri Lanka
Abstract:  This paper attempts to find those determinants stirring the function of money demand in Sri Lanka during 1975-2013. The empirical analysis starts from applying the unit root tests i.e. Ng-Perron. We apply ARDL bound testing approach of co-integration to scrutinize the co-integration in variables. We select independent variables like per capita GDP, interest rate, exchange rate, fiscal deficit, urban population and rural population to determine money demand function. The findings revealed that income, interest rate and fiscal deficit effect money demand significantly and positively. The exchange rate affects negatively and significantly upon money demand. The stable money demand function is found over time applying CUSUM and CUSUMSQ stability test. The model of our study strongly recommends the real demand for M2 is vital monetary aggregate in terms of policy implication including the appropriateness of model in Sri Lanka.

Title:  Puzzling Features of the Historical Income per Capita Distributions Explained
Abstract:  Distributions describing the growth ofthe Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP/cap) arepuzzling. They show that income per capita was approximately constant over hundreds of years, maybe even over thousands of years, but then, as if suddenly it started to increase.The growth was changed apparently rapidly from approximately horizontal to approximately vertical.Numerous efforts have been made to explain these features but we show that they represent nothing more than the purely mathematical property of dividing two hyperbolic distributions. Historical growth of income per capita can be explained as having been controlled by the simple and familiar forces of growth.

Title:  “What are we Wauting for?" Professor Stern Bypasses the Juggernaut Links in Climate Change
Abstract:  Professor N. Stern had had an enormous influence on global warming policy debates. In his 2007 book, he stated the dangerous problem for mankind clearly. And now he comes back with a new book 2016, expressing his frustration about the developments with the UNFCCC and UNEP. The message is: Time is short for policy-making stabilising Planet Earth's climate and thus its overall environment. However, there is an answer to Stern's worry. “What are we waiting for?” in his 2016 book. The COP21 Treaty was possible after years of heavy transaction costs, because it contains the Stern Promise,, i.e. a Super Fund of $100 billion yearly for supporting the giant energy transformation involved in the COP objective of decarbonisation in this century. The COP project stets up global gaming where governments will play their rational strategies including opportunism with guile. Reducing emissions are linked with energy consumption, which is linked with country affluence. Mixing up climate stabilisation with general social development goals (SDG), as economist Sachs suggests, would be a serious mistake, Phycisist Hawkins' recommendation to leave the Earth for some new place in the Universe is but a fairy tale due to lack of energy. Emmissions are linked with energy that is linked with affluence. And all people have the same drive when it comes to money.

Title:  Modeling the Distributive Effects of an Agricultural Shock on Household Income in South Africa: A Sam Multiplier Decomposition and Structurel Path Analysis
Abstract:  Natural resource redistribution and ownership transfer programs are introduced as a way of improving income distribution and alleviating poverty in rural areas of most developing countries. In the case of South Africa, these redistributive policies are implemented in line with the national development plan targeting extreme poverty alleviation and reduction of wide income disparities by 2030. This paper analyses the distributive effects of the land redistribution policy which is a shock in the agriculture sector on poor household income in South Africa by applying a multiplier decomposition and structural path analysis. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing a microscopic analysis of the global multiplier to show the transmission mechanism of household income from a shock into the agriculture sector and show how income moves across sectors, factors and households by dividing the multiplier effects into all its components. The results showed that poor households received higher direct effects and the rich households received high indirect effects from the shock in the agricultural sector. The structural path shows that a significant portion of the global influence of the shock in agriculture is transmitted through the path of factor income which in turn increases poor household income.

Title:  The Second Law as a Cause of the Evolution
Abstract:  It is a common belief that in any environment where life is possible, life will generated. Here it suggested that the cause for a spontaneous generation of complex systems is probability driven processes. Based on equilibrium thermodynamics, it argued that in low occupation number statistical systems, the second law of thermodynamics yields an increase of thermal entropy and a canonic energy distribution. However, in high occupation number statistical systems, the same law for the same reasons yields an increase of information and a Benford's law/power-law energy distribution. It is therefore, plausible, that eventually the heat death is not necessarily the end of the universe.

Title:  Estimating Recreational Value of the Foy's Lake: An Application of Travel Cost Count Data Model for Truncated Zeros
Abstract:  To estimate the annual recreational value provided by the Foy’s Lake, using the most applicable model for on-site data, is the main objective of this study. To adhere to the objective of this study, individual travel cost method (ITCM) has been applied and zero truncated poisson regression model has been found plausible among other models to estimate the consumer surplus. Based on the estimate, the consumer surplus or recreational benefits per trip per visitor can be recommended as BDT 5,875 or US $ 73.44 and counting the consumer surplus per trip per visitor, the annual recreational value (total consumer surplus) provided by the lake is found to be BDT 321 million or US $ 40.2 million.

Title:  Public Investment and GDP Growth in Developing and Advanced Countries: A Panel Data Analysis
Abstract:  This research paper examines the differences between developing and advanced countries in terms of public investment’s impact on economic growth. In this regard, we investigate whether or not the macroeconomic impact of government investment spending is tributary to the degree of private-public capital substitutability and the level of the capital-to-GDP ratio. In this perspective, we use a panel data model for two groups of countries that include respectively five advanced economies and five developing ones. Our study provides empirical evidence that public investment expenditures have a larger influence on GDP’s evolution in developing countries. Our results also suggest that public investment spending is relatively counterproductive in advanced economies, most likely because of high levels of crowding out; the latter are driven by public-private capital substitutability and the advanced position of these countries in terms of transitional dynamics. The analysis in this paper also sheds the light on efficiency, as a concept that is significantly linked to the level of corruption.

Title:  Religious, Ethnic, Linguistic and Cultural Diversity and Female Labor Force Participation
Abstract:  There are numerous macro and micro level determinants of female labor force participation (FLFP) counted in the literature. Besides the other explanatory factors of FLFP, diversification in religion, ethnicity, language and culture in a society may also play an important role in the explanation of FLFP. Therefore this study empirically examines the impact of religion, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity on FLFP by using a cross-section data of 109 countries. We hypothesize that societies with higher level of religion, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity experience higher level of FLFP via interaction across distinct religions, ethnicities, languages, and cultures. Our empirical results endorse our hypothesis for religion, ethnicity, and language except culture. This finding reveals that diversification in religion, ethnicity, and language in a country significantly and positively affects the FLFP level in that country.

Title:  A Political Economy Approach of Institutional Research 
Abstract:  Institutional research is ready to move to the next stage, the stage, as argued by this paper, should be characterized with a more comprehensive and integrated social sciences approach. The theoretical foundation for such a move exists, as the naturel connections between political institutions and economic institutions were well addressed by North, Fukuyama, and Acemoglu; the influences of cultural heritage on the institutional choices were aldo discussed by North and Huntington. Another shift in institutional research proposed by this paper is the change from the general solutions to the specific solutions because the institutional characteristics are individualized after considering the impacts of culture heritage. Through the data analysis of World Governance Index (WGI) and other development indicators this paper presents the connections between political and economic institutions and the unique characteristics of political orders and developmental paths of a few specific groups of countries. The paper also discusses the influences of cultural heritage on the institution’s choice and transformation path. Finally the paper proposes an institutional research framework.

Title:  Economic Growth and the Growth of Human Population in the Past 2,000,000 Years
Abstract:  Growth of human population in the past 2,000,000 years is analysed. It is shown that the growth was in three major stages: (1) 2,000,000 to 27,000 BC, (2)27,000 BC to AD 510 and (3) AD 510 to present. Each stage is described by hyperbolic distribution followed by a significantly shorter, non-hyperbolic transition to a new stage. Data show also a minor disturbance in the third hyperbolic stage. Each hyperbolic stage was prompted by a single force, the biologically-controlled force of procreation expressed as the difference between the biologically-controlled force of sex drive and the biologically-controlled process of aging and dying. The fundamental parameter describing hyperbolic growth is given by the ratio of the force of growth and of the resistance to growth. It is assumed that during transitions, this fundamental force remained the same but the resistance to growth was changing. All these three stages, and the minor disturbance in the middle of the third stage, are now described mathematically and explained. The derived parameters are used to calculate the size of the world population in the past 2,000,000 years and to fill in the gaps between data. These parameters can be used to calculate the growth rate at any time in the past 2,000,000 years. Analysis of population data and the earlier analysis of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita allow also for the evaluation of the economic growth in the past 2,000,000 years. The size of the population and the GDP values are tabulated.

Title:  Estimating the Threshold Level of Inflation for Thailand
Abstract:  This paper analyzes the relationship between inflation and economic growth in Thailand using annual dataset during 1990 and 2015. The threshold model is estimated for different levels of threshold inflation rate. The results suggest that the threshold level of inflation above which inflation significantly slow growth is estimated at 3 percent. The negative relationship between inflation and growth is apparent above this threshold level of inflation. In other words, the inflation rate that is higher than this threshold level can jeopardize the growth rate of the country.

Title:  Impulse on the Aggregate Demand in Bolivia through the Coordination of the Monetary and Fiscal Policy in Crisis Time 
Abstract:  At the end of 2014, the Bolivian economy, despite facing negative external shocks (falling oil prices), registered a high economic growth in the region of Latin America. Monetary policy was aimed at keeping the government bond rate close to zero and raising liquidity levels in the economy (monetary policy expansive). On the part of the government, the two main sources of income of the nonfinancial public sector (SPNF) are: i) tax revenues and ii) the sale of hydrocarbons (gas), at that time Bolivia's fiscal policy was countercyclical To the behavior of the Latin American Product (increases in fiscal expenditure in infrastructure). These antecedents, aid to the interest of the study of the coordination of the economic policy in Bolivia. The structure of a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Model (DSGE) helps us to understand the transmission channels of shocks (in Taylor rule, Phillips curve and public investment) and how the monetary and fiscal policy reacts to these shocks.

Title:  The Importance of Knowledge Assets on University-Industry Collaboration: A Preliminary
Abstract:  Intellectual capital is an important base for inter-organizational collaborative activities, including the industry-academic collaboration studied here. A preliminary study was conducted with analytic hierarchy process method, trying to know the dimensionalized associations between intellectual capital (i.e., Human, Structural, Customers, Organizational, Process, knowledge, and innovation capitals) and industry-academic collaboration (i.e., academic engagement and commercialization). Analyzing expert opinions, we gained matrices and priority scores, indicating that different forms of intellectual capital have different influences on academic engagement versus commercialization. The results remind scholarly works to look into detailed and differentiated mechanisms that utilize intellectual capital for governing industry-academic collaboration.

Title:  Evaluation of Bulk Cargo According to Turkish Maritime Transportation 
Abstract:  Maritime transportation offers new opportunities and challenges for all the countries. The many advantages of maritime transportation are more than other transportation types. Maritime transportation is the backbone of the World Economy. It is generally believed that nearly 90% of world trade is carried by sea.  According to UNCTAD records – world seaborne trade volumes were estimated to have exceeded 10 billion tons annually with bulk cargo. In 2015, dry cargo shipments accounted for 70.7 per cent of total seaborne trade volumes. Because of this high quantity, in this paper aims to discussed the importance of bulk cargo in Turkish trad.

Title:  Julien Chaisse & Tsai-yu Lin (Eds.), International Economic Law and Governance: Essays in Honour of Mitsuo Matsushita 
Abstract:  WTO today stands at a crucial crossroad. On one hand the multilateral negotiations are progressing at a snail’s pace, often dis-incentivizing Member countries from undertaking additional liberalization commitments. On the other hand, the regional collaborations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) are losing relevance, given the recent decision of the US to pull out. As a result, several countries are now treading on a path inclined towards protectionist intents, much to the chagrin of their partners. The emerging development has enormous implications for the interaction between WTO Members at the Dispute Settlement (DS) forum, where the possible violations of the multilateral commitments are analyzed.

Title:  Application of differential equations in projecting growth trajectories
Abstract:  Mathematical method based on a direct or indirect analysis of growth rates is described. It is shown how simple assumptions and a relatively easy analysis can be used to describe mathematically complicated trends and to predict growth. Only rudimentary knowledge of calculus is required. Projected trajectories based on such simple initial assumptions are easier to accept and to understand than alternative complicated projections based on more complicated assumptions and on more intricate computational procedures. Examples of the growth of population and of the growth of the Gross Domestic Product are used to illustrate the application of this method of forecasting.

Title:  Responding to the will of the machine: Leadership in the age of artificial intelligence 
Abstract:  The advent of artificial intelligence in the modern economy will revolutionize the workplace of tomorrow. It will alsocreate never-seen-before challenges for leadership. The current leadership theory is extensive but it does not address on how to lead in a workplace composed of intelligent machines. However, it can be observed that leadership theory tends to develop in tandem with the developments in technology - metaphorically termed as will of the machine in this article. Specifically, two phases of leadership require analysis. First, the leadership needed to lead firms through the great transformation from industrial/information to a cognitive economy. Second, leadership needed to manage and lead firms once a relative degree of stability and maturity is reached where intelligent machines occupy the central positon in the workforce.  While extensive work exists in leadership theory, this article fills the gap that bridges thefield of applied artificial intelligence with the leadership theory.

Abstract:  The paper undertakes an evolutionary analysis of Pakistan’s national competitiveness with special reference to exports from 1950-2010. The analysis suggests that post 1980s trade liberalization, some visible improvements can be seen in production efficiencies in Pakistan but they were not translated into improved agriculture or industry competitiveness. The major export items like garments and rice have seen a steady decline in value over the years..

Abstract:  Innovation capital is a key for national progress, especially for those categorized as developing countries. This paper reports multi-indicators and measures of innovation capital of Malawi and offer multiple year trend analysis. Collecting data from secondary, objective data bases, our results demonstrated that, public and large-scale surveys are needed for collecting information about business R&D investment, the industry-academic collaboration, as well as intellectual property management – these data are somewhat neglected. Positively, the results observe gradual growth in the aspects of research personnel and scientific publication, which enrich the country’s innovation capability. These results shed lights on the policy making and business practices.

Title:  Smile curve and its linkages with global value chains
Abstract:  The concept and logic of ‘smile curve’ in the context of global value chains has gained importance in recent time period and discussed at the individual firm level, but rarely identified and investigated at the sectoral level using real data for cross-country analysis. Using TIVA database for 2001 and 2011 time period, several conceptual value chain are investigated including exports of Base Metals, Computer Electronics, Electrical Machinery and Transportation equipment’s in Asian Economies. This paper focuses an idea to measure both the strength and linkages between producers and consumers of global value chain. The identified smile curve provides a very intuitive understanding of the roles played by different countries in various sectors and helps in identifying the benefits gained by them through their participation in global trade. The dynamics of structural upgrading and interactive growth via trade and investment within a hierarchy of countries is aligned with “flying-geese (FG)” theory of growth. The paper also gives emphasis on the role of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership in broadening economic integration.

Title:  Emigrant’s remittances, Dutch Disease and capital accumulation: The case of Mekong countries
Abstract:  This paper examines the sectoral and intertemporal impacts of international emigrant remittances by using a vector auto-regression (VAR) estimation focusing on Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV countries). The reason for targeting the CLMV countries is that they have still depended largely on remittance-earnings from their emigrant workers in their economies, and that the macroeconomic impacts of received remittances would be critical for their sustainable growth. The empirical study identified the decline in manufacturing-service ratio (the Dutch Disease effect) as a sectoral effect of remittances, and also the decline in investment-consumption ratio (the deteriorated capital accumulation effect) as their intertemporal effect, judging from the causalities and dynamic responses from remittances to both ratio in the VAR estimation outcomes. The strategic implication is that the CLMV countries should establish a framework to mobilize their remittance-earnings for more productive use.

Title:  How climate and agriculture fares with food security in Pakistan?
Abstract:  In this paper we measure all the components of food security.  The objective of the study is tomeasure the impact of Area under cultivation, Mechanical inputs, and Average Rainfall (mm per year) on food security index. Auto-regressive distributed lagged model (ARDL) is used in both models. In model 1 the data is from 1990-2014 and in model 2 the data is from 1973-2014. On the basis of our analysis we suggest that agricultural factors are significantly affecting the food production in case of Pakistan.

Title:  Impact of export incentive schemes on the performance of agricultural exports in Nigeria
Abstract:  This paper examines the impact of export incentive schemes on the Performance of agricultural exports in Nigeria, using quarterly time series data from 1990-2014. The study employed Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model to cointegration analysis and Granger causality test to examine the long run and causality relationship between growth in the Performance of agricultural exports and export incentive schemes in Nigeria. The bounds tests used in the study revealed that there is no long run equilibrium relationship between export incentive schemes and the performance of agricultural exports in Nigeria. It is of high importance to note that the granger casualty test indicates that there was a unidirectional relationship running from agricultural export (AGR) to export expansion grant (EEG), export development fund (EDF) to agricultural export (AGR). Since the findings of the study show that export development fund has positive and significant impact on the performance of agricultural exports in Nigeria, the study suggests that major concern should be given to its management and disbursement to ensure stable growth in the sub-component (agriculture) of non-oil export in Nigeria. This can be achieved through adequate funding by the concerned authority.

Title:  Factors affecting the rate of unemployment in GCC countries
Abstract:  The objective of this study is to investigate which variables have a significant effect on unemployment rate in gulf countries using a panel data technique. Four variables were employed to determine their relationship to unemployment rate. The result confirms that two variables play an essential role to determinant unemployment rate in the GCC countries. Government's expenditure as a percentage of GDP play an important role in decreasing unemployment rate since they have the power to shape policies. Governments in the GCC countries should create policies that encourage their citizens to get knowledge and enhance their ability through creating a social program to be ready working anywhere. Since the education is a part of government expenditure and most of GCC countries start concentrating in this factor because most of studies discover that there is a negative relationship between education and unemployment. Moreover, the estimated model provides that GDP per capita plays an essential role to determine unemployment rate in GCC countries. Therefore, I can conclude that Okun's law is occur in the case of GCC countries. Also, in case of GCC countries Structural unemployment is occurred which caused by forces other than the business cycle. It occurs when an underlying shift in the economy makes it difficult for some groups to find jobs.

Title:  Measuring degree of globalization of African Countries on almost equimarginal contribution principle
Abstract:  This paper is an exercise in construction of an alternative globalization index for 43 countries in Africa.  It has used a new method for measurement of the degree of globalization (or construction of a globalization index) based on minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values, the concept borrowed from the cooperative game theory. It assigns weights to constituent variables such that their mean expected marginal contribution to the synthetic index is as equitable as possible. Since this index is based on combinatorial logic, it is also less likely to be affected by outlier data points.  Globalization index for 43 African countries (for a time series of 45 years, 1970-2014) has been constructed. The new index has been compared with the KOF index of globalization for the countries under study.  As its validation, it has been found that the index has stronger correlation (vis-à-vis the KOF index) with Human Development index, Corruption Perception index, Freedom index and the indicators of abject poverty in the African countries. Viewed as such the new index represents globalization closely in connection with other relevant socio-economic measures than its rival (KOF index of globalization) as well as it is based on more plausible theoretical premises based on marginal contribution rather than correlation.

Title:  Ownership structure in BIST - Capital structure relation Granger causality test a comparative application between BIST industrial index and service index
Abstract:   In this study, it was aimed to determine whether there is a bidirectional relationship between the ownership and capital structures through the variables representing the ownership and capital structures of 142 businesses, which are included in the Service and Industrial Indexes of Borsa Istanbul (BIST) between the years of 2006-2014. The capital structure in the research is represented by the leverage ratio (TBTV), which determines the extent to which a business is dependent on debt and to determine how much of the assets owned by the business are financed with debt, while the ownership structure is represented by the largest shareholder’s equity (EBOP), the foreign share (YAP), the corporate investor ratio (KURY) and the number of the shareholders with more than 10% share of the business (ORTAK). The factors influencing the bi-directional causality between the ownership and the capital structures were researched with the Panel Vector Autoregressive Model (VAR). In the scope of the VAR analysis, Granger causality test and the impulse response analyzes were also performed. It was found in the result of the analysis that in the model where the capital structure (TBTV) is a dependent variable in the service index, none of the independent variables belonging to the ownership structure has a causality relation through the TBTV. In the model where the variables belonging to the ownership structure were dependent variables, it was found that the independent variable belonging to the capital structure (TBTV) is the reason of the change in the ownership variables of EBOP, HAO and KURY variables. According to the results obtained, 1 period delay in the capital structure causes decrease in EBOP and HAO; increase in KURY. As to the businesses in the industrial index, a causality relationship was not seen between the ownership structures and the capital structures in the context of these variables and the two structures do not effect each other.

Title:  A theory of wealth accumulation differences considering modern net savings gradualism the impact of unresolved long run differences in wealth accumulation on the annualized net savings in the USA
Abstract:  In other words, for those who monitor relative wealth accumulation and are unmoved by divine empathy, a disincentive to increase the rate of full manumission is possible. Consider slavery as overt, formal constraints to zero or even negative wealth accumulation; and consider freedom of ex-slaves as the perception of overt lack of formal wealth constraints and yet the possibility of covert, hidden or informal constrained wealth accumulation controls (i.e. southern Jim Crow laws); and finally, consider full manumission as the uninhibited opportunity to accumulate wealth at rates of entities without a history of slavery or with a more limited history of slavery. This definition of full manumission probably includes the necessity of wealth transfers to the fully manumitted ex-slave in transition from slavery or free ex-slave to full manumission. Nevertheless, this negatively bounded correlation between duration of time from the end of enslavement and magnitude of unexplained differences in wealth suggests the magnitude in the unexplained portion of white-black wealth differences increases as the length of time from the real end of enslavement decreases.

Title:  Does globalization affect female labor force participation: Panel evidence
Abstract:  Various theoretical and empirical dimensions of the subject of globalization have been intensively examined in the literature of social science, particularly since 1990s. Besides those existing studies in the literature, we empirically investigate the effect of globalization on the woman’s participation to labor force for four distinct globalization indicators (i.e., economic globalization, social globalization, politic globalization, and overall globalization index). An unbalanced data containing the years of 1990-2014 for 101 countries in the largest sense has been utilized in the analyses. Estimation results imply that there is a positive statistically significant relationship between economic globalization, social globalization, overall globalization and female labor force participation. On the other hand we found a negative statistically significant association between politic globalization and female labor force participation. Meantime it was seen that all of the covariates used in the analyses took the expected signs and were statistically significant in almost all models.

Title:  Capital structure in U.S., a quantile regression approach with macroeconomic impacts
Abstract:  The major perspective of this paper is to provide more evidence into the empirical determinants of capital structure adjustment in different macroeconomics states by focusing and discussing the relative importance of firm-specific and macroeconomic characteristics from an alternative scope in U.S. This study extends the empirical research on the topic of capital structure by focusing on a quantile regression method to investigate the behavior of firm-specific characteristics and macroeconomic variables across all quantiles of distribution of leverage (total debt, long-terms debt and short-terms debt). Thus, based on a partial adjustment model, we find that long-term and short-term debt ratios varying regarding their partial adjustment speeds; the short-term debt raises up while the long-term debt ratio slows down for same periods.

Title:  What are the most important factors that influence the changes in London Real Estate Prices? How to quantify them?
Abstract:  In recent years, real estate industry has captured government and public attention around the world. The factors influencing the prices of real estate are diversified and complex. However, due to the limitations and one-sidedness of their respective views, they did not provide enough theoretical basis for the fluctuation of house price and its influential factors. The purpose of this paper is to build a housing price model to make the scientific and objective analysis of London's real estate market trends from the year 1996 to 2016 and proposes some countermeasures to reasonably control house prices.  Specifically, the paper analyzes eight factors which affect the house prices from two aspects: housing supply and demand and find out the factor which is of vital importance to the increase of housing price per square meter. The problem of a high level of multicollinearity between them is solved by using principal components analysis.

Title:  When is trade good for the poor? Evidence from recent literature
Abstract:  The paper reviews recent literature that tries to find the relationship of trade with economic growth, poverty and inequality. The analysis suggests that trade may be good for the poor but if it leads to inequality especially in industrial wages, it may be detrimental to sustainable economic development. A valid strategy to make trade good for growth and the poor is to invest in education at all levels. A gender sensitive education policy may go a long way in sowing the seeds of better economic management.

Title:  Theorem of not independence of any technological innovation
Abstract:  The theorem of not independence of any technological innovation states that in the long run, the behavior and evolution of any technological innovation is not independent from the behavior and evolution of the other technological innovations. In particular, any technological innovation does not function as an independent system per se, but each innovation depends on the other technological innovations to form a complex system of parts that interact and coevolve in a non-simple way. The theorem of not independence of any technological innovation can explain and generalize, whenever possible, one of the characteristics of the evolution of technology that generates technological and economic change in human society.

Title:  Critique of impact assessment of regional trade agreements using non-tariff measures
Abstract:  Are cent study undertaken by Kawasaki (2017) uses a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to estimate the impact of removal tariffs and non-tariff measures on trade flows and the overall gross domestic product (GDP) of the remaining 11 countries in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP11) partner countries. This note attempts to provide insights into such estimations so as to help in real impact assessments of the tariff and non-tariff provisions of agreements such as the TPP11. It warns that policy makers who seek to rely on such studies need to be aware of the large number of assumptions that underlie the quantification of the non-tariff measures, including that regulation is necessarily negative for trade, and other limitations of the methodology used. The paper also notes these are only one aspect of the broader economic impacts of an agreement that includes chapters on intellectual property, investor protections, government procurement, and state-owned enterprises, among others.

Title:  2008 Global economic crisis: A commentary
Abstract:  The most common narrative about the causes of the 2008 crisis is centered on the housing market in the United States and the inability of many lenders to repay their loans. The so-called “deregulation” of the financial system that began in the 1980s in Great Britain and continued in the 1990s (Mankiw & Taylor, 2010) could be, however, considered as the starting point. By “deregulation” we mean a change in the institutional framework so that the rules and regulations concerning the operation of banks and other financial institutions are either abolished or become more flexible. In the era of the Thatcher government in the Great Britain, the banking system changed radically, as a series of restrictions on bank financing were abolished. Throughout the decade of 1990s, the restrictions became more flexible, allowing financial institutions to operate more freely, while the law Gramm-Leach-Blilay of 1999 (also known as “The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999”) abolished the differences between commercial and estate banks, insurance and stock exchange companies.
