Title: Economic Analysis on Pakistan 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: In this book we analyze the institutional arrangement between various actors to understand how ICT project objectives flow among actors in a standard LINCOS project and how they would affect the sustainability and effectiveness of LINCOS in particular and an ICT project in general. Since there are many actors involved in different stages and processes of a single LINCOS project, the paper analyses the bilateral and multilateral relationships among these actors to understand the factors that might affect the efficiency of the ICT project. In other words the paper looks at the actors involved in a LINCOS project in an effort to capture those circumstances under which a LINCOS project is exposed to principal- agent problems.

Title: The Entrepreneurial Reach 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The main theme of this book is that entrepreneurship has become a global phenomenon, having spread widely throughout the world, and is considered a major force behind economic prosperity, job growth, and wealth creation. Its close relationship with the introduction of innovative products, new business models, and production technologies has added to its mystique and broad appeal. In addition to the growing interest in business-oriented entrepreneurship, there has been a revival, in recent years, of interest in social entrepreneurship which aims at introducing radical innovative solutions to social and environmental problems that the free market and governments have failed to address or solve. This book discusses the state of entrepreneurship from both the domestic and global perspectives. It also explores how entrepreneurial enterprises can establish and sustain a culture of innovation that would increase their competitive advantage and prospects for long-term survival and growth. The thesis in this presentation is that entrepreneurship and innovation are inseparable; and that small/ entrepreneurial firms often have an advantage over many large firms in innovating and introducing desirable changes. Three chapters are devoted to introducing potential entrepreneurs to different kinds of entrepreneurship, mainly social entrepreneurship, e-entrepreneurship, and international entrepreneurship. This exposure makes it possible for them to choose from these alternatives in planning their new ventures. What these different types of entrepreneurship have in common is that they provide individuals – who have entrepreneurial spirit, zeal and skills- with an opportunity to introduce their innovative ideas, models, and technologies that would make a difference in the marketplace or in society at large. An added contribution of this book is the appendices that present a step-by-step guide to planning new ventures, factors that are considered in seeking and getting bank loans as a part of the start-up capital, and export procedures and guidelines. These appendices are presented in a simple and clear manner in order to ease the concerns of those who have no prior experience in starting a business or in getting into the global market as exporters of goods and services.

Title: The Solution is Full Reserve / 100% Reserve Banking 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The term full reserve (FR) refers here to the system advocated by the following, among others.
1. Laurence Kotlikoff, economics professor in Boston. See Kotlikoff (2012). However, for a quick introduction to Kotlikoff’s ideas see Klein (2013).
2. Richard Werner, economics professor in Southampton, UK. See Werner (2011).
3. Milton Friedman. See Friedman (1960, Ch3, starting at heading entitled “Banking Reform”).
4. James Tobin, economics Nobel Laureate. See Tobin (1985&1987).
5. Merton Miller, economics Nobel Laureate and co-author of the “Modigliani-Miller” theory.
6. Ben Dyson, founder of Positive Money. See Dyson (2012).
7. John Cochrane, economics professor in Chicago. See Cochrane (2013).
8. Irving Fisher, professor of political economy at Yale in the early 1900s. See Fisher (1936).
FR is sometimes called “100% reserve banking”, while German speakers use the word “Vollgeld”.The following few paragraphs are a brief summary of FR.
Commercial banks create money when they make loans, as explained by an article published by the Bank of England – McLeay (2014) And that freedom to create money is a subsidy of banks, for reasons given by for example Huber (2000, p.31, 2nd paragraph). As Huber says, if commercial banks can simply print the money they lend out, rather than obtain such money in the same way every non bank firm obtains money, i.e. earn it or borrow it, then commercial banks can lend at an artificially low rate of interest. Or to put it more strongly, as explained by the Nobel laureate economist, Maurice Allais, private money creation amounts to counterfeiting (See Phillips, 1992).
Another flaw in the existing bank system is that it breaks a widely accepted principle namely that it is not the job of taxpayers to rescue commercial ventures which go wrong. That is, while everyone has a right to a totally safe method of lodging and transferring money, and while that activity is not inherently commercial, anyone who wants their bank to lend on their money so as to earn interest is clearly into commerce, in exactly the same way as where they deposit money with a private pension scheme, stockbroker, mutual fund / unit trust, or buy corporate bonds. For governments to offer taxpayer backed deposit insurance for banks which invest or lend on money while not offering the same service for mutual funds etc which do the same is a glaring inconsistency.

Title: Economic Impacts of the 2010 Floods in North Sindh: A Hicksian Compensating Variation Approach 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Present study has applied Hicksian Compensating Variation approach for empirical estimation of the welfare loss in the households of the four selected districts of North Sindh (Qamber Shahdadkot, Kashmore-Kandhkot, Jacobabad and Shikarpur) that were severely affected during flood 2010. The income and substitution effects were estimated from Marshallian demand curves. Slutsky equation is applied to isolate the income effect from the total effect to estimate the Hicksian demand equations. The total intervention estimated to be required was approximately PKR 61.16 billion in the four selected districts however the total intervention provided in the form of rescue, relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction was equal to PKR 47.2 billion. A short fall of approximately PKR 15 billion was observed. The Hicksian Compensation required estimated per household per month is to the tune of PKR 11703 per month.

Title: Pakistan’s Trade Competitiveness & Complementarities in South Asia 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Over the past decade Pakistan remained involved in two major trade agreements with in the South Asia (Pakistan & Sri-Lanka FTA and SAFTA). It is meaningful from an operational and policy perspective to evaluate Pakistan’s trade performance in South Asia against its objectives of greater trade integration and suggest policy interventions to improve its effectiveness. In order to achieve this objective, current study evaluates the Pakistan’s overall and chapter-wise trade performance with SAARC major SAARC economies for the last seven years (2003-09). This study has been disaggregated into two parts: In the first part of the study, an assessment of trade performance of SAARC members is carried out with respect to the rest of the world. Pakistan’s trade performance vis-à-vis other SAARC members is the focus of this part. In the second part Pakistan’s trade performance in South Asia has been analyzed and policy interventions have been suggested to improve its effectiveness. Certain trade indicators like Trade Complementarity Index (TCI), Trade Specialization Index (TSI), Grubel Lloyd Index (GLI), Revealed Comparative Analysis (RCA), Bilateral Revealed Comparative Analysis BRCAs and Revealed Market Access (RMA) have been employed to achieve the above objectives.

Title: A Critical Appraisal of the Conceptualization of Public Park and Recreation Marketing 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The objectives of the study were (a) to identify the reasons and concerns of those public administrators and marketing scholars who do not accept the usefulness of marketing in the public sector; (b) to deconstruct, comprehend, interpret, and critically appraise the current conceptualization of public sector marketing from the viewpoint of negativists identified in step (a); and (c) to reconstruct, redefine, reinterpret, and reoperationalize the current controversial conceptualization of public sector marketing into a new conceptualization in the context of park and recreation services. The critical theory approach to the study primary used non-empirical procedures data collection and analytic procedures which included investigative research, negative case analysis, and theoretical triangulation. These procedures were supplemented with empirical data collected from in-depth interviews with five scholars and with three parks and recreation managers. Results of the non-empirical procedures revealed the biased selective nature of the current conceptualization of public park and recreation marketing and the existence of alternative conceptualizations which have been ignored. The existing and alternative models were discussed with scholars and park and recreation managers. Support was found for the alternative models. From these data an alternative conceptualization of public park and recreation marketing was developed and named the concept of administered marketing. Implications for park and recreation managers are discussed. Directions for future research into the administratively managed park and recreation marketing concept are suggested.

Title: Full Reserve Banking 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Under the existing bank system, it is not just central banks and governments which create money: commercial banks do so as well. Many leading economists, including at least five Nobel laureate economists, have had doubts as to whether commercial banks should be allowed to do that. Indeed one of those Nobel laureates, Maurice Allais, described money creation by commercial banks as counterfeiting.“Full reserve” and “100% reserve” are names given to bank systems where commercial banks are not allowed to create or “print” money, or at least where that money creation is curtailed. Other names include “Sovereign Money” and “Vollgeld”.The arguments for and against full reserve are complicated. One of the best arguments for full reserve, put by Joseph Huber among others, is that letting commercial banks create money amounts to a subsidy of those banks: clearly a money lender (and that is what commercial banks are) which can simply create the money it lends out is in a better position than a money lender who has to obtain money the same way every household and non-bank firm obtains money: earning it or borrowing it.

Abstract: The main purpose of this study is to understand the impact of age on work values, organizational commitment and work centrality. In this respect, it is hypothezied that there are differences in work values, organizational commitment, and work centrality among age groups. In addition, therelationship of organizational commitment with work values, and work centrality in different age groups is explored. The study was conducted in Istanbul, Turkey with the participation of 935 university graduate, corporate white-collar employees of large companies in Istanbul. In-depth interviews were conducted for the qualitative stage and a web-based survey was administered for the quantitative stage of data collection. An important contribution of this study is the emic items identified for the Turkish work context. These emic itemsare suggested to be incorporatedtowork values inventory for future research. The results indicateddifferences in work values, and organizational commitment levels among different age groups as well as changes among age groups in the level of importance of work. It was confirmed that there is a relationship between work values and organizational commitment, and between work centrality and organizational commitment. The results of the study also showed that work values differ according to gender.

Title: Agrarian and Rural Revitalisation Issues in China and Bulgarian 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Around the globe, revitalization of agrarian and rural sector is one of the most topical issues for farmers, agrarian and rural communities, interest groups, researchers, investors, policymakers, and the public at large.In China and Bulgaria there are numerous publications on individual issues of agrarian and rural revitalization and sustainable development. Despite enormous progress in the theory and practice in that important new area, there are few comprehensive studies on the entire spectrum of agrarian and rural revitalization issuesin these two countries, and on their interactions with public policies, private and collective strategies and forms, market and technological development, social and communities’ dynamics, etc. What is more, there are no join and comparative studies on Chinese and Bulgarian experiences, despite quite similar historical development, fundamental transformation and modernization in the last several decades, and alike socio-economic and environmental challenges at current stage of development.This book is the result of an on-going research cooperation of the teams from the leading academic institutions in China and Bulgaria such as Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, Communication University of China in Beijing, Institute of Agricultural Economics in Sofia, Agrarian University in Plovdiv, and University of National and World Economy in Sofia.Our motivation in writing this book is to respond to the theoretical and practical needs for modern understanding and assessment of the agrarian and rural revitalization and sustainable development issues in China and Bulgaria. We extend our previous research in that area, incorporating recent developments in the field, and identifying the major achievements and challenges of sustainable agrarian and rural development, analyzing evolution and modernization of major sectors of agrarian and rural economy, and presenting key governance and technological innovations in agri-food and rural sectorin both countries. Our ultimate goal is to assist the general awareness of agrarian and rural revitalization issues in China and Bulgaria, withdraw lessons from the positive experiences of both countries, and support public policies, and private and collective strategies and actions for sustainable development.

Title: Evidence-based Unified Growth Theory Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Unified Growth Theory published by Oded Galor is called unified because it puts together earlier attempts to explain the historical economic growth and the historical growth of population. These attempts were made over many years and by now they form the established knowledge in economics and in demography.Unfortunately, the past research was difficult because (1) access to data was strongly limited and (2) growth turns out to be represented by strongly deceptive distributions. They create an illusion of stagnation followed by a sudden explosion, while in fact they increase monotonically all the time and there is no sudden transition from a slow to fast growth. Data represented by these distributions have to be carefully and methodically analysed; otherwise conclusions are based on illusions.Galor was in a far better position than many of the past researchers because he had access to superb and extensive sets of data made available by the world renown economist, Angus Maddison. These data describe economic growth and the growth of population, global, regional and even in individual countries. They are a rich source of information, which Galor failed to use. He made no attempt to analyse them.

Title: Foreign Influence in Turkish Stock Market 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Relatively higher return expectations, tax exempt environment, low correlation with the returns in developed markets, and the ongoing European accession process have attracted non-domestic funds to the ISE recently. In this period, it is seen that foreign inflows have broadened the investor base and have affected security prices. The price impact of a 1 % increase in the share of foreign funds according to the market capitalization, results in an increase of 2.77 % – 3.57 % in the returns of the ISE 30. Foreign inflows have significant influence on the ISE even after controlling for the omitted variables used in this thesis. It has also been determined that non-domestic funds chase returns and engage in positive feedback trading when they invest in the ISE. The scope of this book is the effects of foreign order flow and resulting change in the liquidity levels, on stock returns. Even though there are numerous studies about the effects of order flow on stock prices and the relationship between liquidity and stock prices have also been studied widely in the literature, the impact of foreign participation on a market is relatively undermined in the literature. One of the reasons may be the fact that the differentiation of order flows as domestic flows and foreign flows became popular in the last two decades when foreign investors increased their significance and dominance in these markets. Developing Information Technology and pervasiveness of internet enabled funds to flow in and out of countries and consequently, researchers aimed to assess whether foreign funds are detrimental or not to the markets they study. Moreover, the existing studies that examine the effects of order flows mostly cover the developed markets where foreign funds are usually a minority but ISE is heavily dominated by foreign funds, the participation rate of foreigners equal to % 66.55 as of 20-11 2009 and this market may give out promising outcomes as it is an emerging market that doesn’t have much prominence in the related literature.

Title: Impact of the Crises on the Efficiency of the Financial Market: Evidence from the SDM 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The efficient market hypothesis has been around since 1962, the theory based on a simple rule that states the price of any asset must fully reflect all available information. Yet there is empirical evidence suggesting that markets are too volatile to be efficient. In essence, this evidence seems to suggest that the reaction of the market participants to the information or events that is the crucial factor, rather than the actual information. This highlights the need to include the behavioural finance theory in the pricing of assets. Essentially, the research aims to analyse the efficiency of six key sovereign debt markets during a period of changing volatility including the recent global financial and sovereign debt crises. We analyse the markets in the pre-crisis period and during the financial and sovereign debt crises to determine the impact of the crises on the efficiency of these financial markets. We use two GARCH-based variance bound tests to test the null hypothesis of the market being too volatile to be efficient. Proposing a GJR-GARCH variant of the variance bound test to account for variation in the asymmetrical effect. This leads to an analysis of the changing behaviour of price volatility to identify what makes the market efficient or inefficient. In general, our EMH tests resulted in mixed results, hinting at the acceptance of the null hypothesis of the market being too volatile to be efficient. However, interestingly a number of 2017 observations under both models seem to be hinting at the rejection of the null hypothesis. Furthermore, our proposed GJR-GARCH variant of the variance bound test seems to be more likely to accept the EMH than the GARCH variant of the test.

Title: Nominal Tales of (for) Real Economies: Taste for Inflation, Trade Money, Collaterals and Reserve Requirements 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book explores the real effects of the monetization of a stylized one-sector capital growth model driven by rational representative agents. On the one hand, it introduces the appropriate adjustment to the state variable dynamic accounting equation to reflect a (paper) cash-in-advance or trade money finance constraint in the presence of exogenous real reserve requirements. Such constraint embeds real convertibility – even if not for idle real reserves-, conformable with the role of money as both general means of payment, unit of account and store of value, and with the purchase of money at the inverse of the (real product) general price level. Commodity money then arises as the special case of a 100% (real…) required reserve ratio. On the other, it suggests generalizations of the state equation that (also) encompass product immobilization – production-before-expenditure – constraints, as well as delays, or even real losses, along the money creation process, that, as the CIA assumption, reflect on inventory stock rotation. Additionally, one concludes that efficient outcomes require the use of (at least) two policy instruments. Two types of objective functions are considered: a standard accumulated discounted felicity function; and a point-wise utility function embedding bequest motives. Generalizations assuming taste for nominal growth at the utility level were staged for each case – taste for inflation may reflect psychological traits, compounding to and of similar nature to time discounting, implying distaste for increases in the (real) size of the nominal unit of account, working similarly to money illusion – possibly, to nominal discounting of utility over nominal arguments. Also, productivity enhancement due to nominal growth – working, say, through ease of inventory drainage – was simulated. Technically (mathematically), the hypotheses are convenient to generate non-negative growth of optimal per capita nominal money balances – and, therefore, prices – along the (and…) steady states. In real economies, price stability insures the constancy of money as measurement unit; such devices allowed to at least achieve a stable (non-negative) balanced inflation growth rate – but are consistent with residual barter trade of unsold merchandise. Nominal MIU was therefore also tested, as felicity functions combining real as nominal consumption as arguments. The analysis relies on a discrete methodology. A storable good economy is briefly confronted with some of the structures. Contrast (and merger) with a high-powered money supply multiplier mechanism is also briefly outlined. Time interval between transactions, the money rotation period, is endogenised.

These data describe economic growth and the growth of population, global, regional and even in individual countries. They are a rich source of information, which Galor failed to use. He made no attempt to analyse them.

Title: The Economics of Science and Innovation: New Directions 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: One of the most significant topics in economics and social sciences is to explain the active role that science and technological innovation play in the economic and social change of nations.Firstly, the term innovation and science advances are used so widely to indicate something new and different. However, this definition doesn’t tell us how we would recognize an innovation and science advances, how we could categorize them, how to explain their origin and evolution, as well as how to measure them in markets and society.The goal of this book is to explain some characteristics of technological innovation and science in society. In particular, this book focuses on new researches that can clarify the origins of studies concerning science and innovation, the categorization of innovation, the sources and aspects of the evolution of innovation and some techniques to measure technological advances and predict which technologies are likely to evolve rapidly in society.This book is designed for students, undergraduate, graduate or managers in business and public administration that wish to clarify critical concepts in the field of science and technological innovation and that wish to expand their knowledge on these subjects areas.

Title: Agricultural Impact of the Great East Japan Earthquake – Six Years Later 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: On March 11, 2011 the strongest ever recorded in Japan earthquake occurred, also known as the Great East Japan Earthquake, which triggered a powerful tsunami and caused a nuclear accident in one of the world biggest nuclear power stations – Fukushima Daichi. More than six years after the triple disaster the overall impacts on Japanese agri-food chains is far from being completelydue to the scale of the disasters and the number of affected agents, the effects’ multiplicities, spillovers, and long time horizon, the constant evolution of the nuclear crisis, the lack of “full” information and models of analysis, etc. This paper presents updates on the impacts of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan on country’s agriculture and food sector. First, disaster events and their effects is outlined. Second, impact on farms and agricultural resources is estimated. Third, impact on food industries is assessed. Next, extend of radioactive contamination of agri-food products is presented and effects on markets, consumers and international trade evaluated. Chapter summarises responses of different agents, assesses progress and challenges in post-disaster recovery and reconstruction, and withdrawlessons from the Japanese experiences.

Title: Investigating the Optimum Manager-Subordinate Relationship of a Discontinuity Theory of Managerial Organizations: An Exploratory Study of a General Theory of Managerial Hierarchy 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book explores the requisite relationship between managers and their subordinates in managerial hierarchies as stipulated by a general theory of managerial hierarchy (GTMH) developed by Dr. Elliott Jaques. Dr. Jaques writes, “When managers and immediate subordinates are in roles in adjacent layers, things can work well; if within same layer, the manager is “breathing down the necks” of the subordinates; if more than one layer apart, the manager is “pulled down in the weeds”. Jaques’ empirical finding of the Manager-Subordinate Relationship (MSR) describes how a subordinate, in a managerial hierarchy, feels towards the manager, and how the manager feels towards the subordinate. Optimum MSR is achieved when the subordinate feels just right towards the manager. In Optimum MSR, the manager also feels just right towards the subordinate and that the subordinate does not “pull the manager into the weeds.” In the non-Optimal Manager-Subordinate Relationship (non-effective management according to Dr. Jaques’ theory), the subordinate reports either that the manager is too close (breathing down the necks), or too far (pulled down into the weeds). The manager in non-Optimum MSR also reports either of the two conditions: that the subordinate is either too close or too far. The relationship between the working stratum of managers and subordinates and Jaques’ manager-subordinate relationship-types has not been tested. This study is the first attempt to test these specific theoretical propositions developed by Jaques, and possibly advance general theory of managerial hierarchy. The study’s primary research question is whether there is a relationship between the working roles of the managers and subordinates, and Jaques’ MSR. The study’s exploratory secondary research question attempts to discover the effects of the current potential capability of manager and subordinate on the MSR as defined by Jaques and Cason. The effects of current potential capability on the MSR are not described by general theory of managerial hierarchy, though Dr. Jaques discussed privately with the author the possibility that capabilities may play a significant part (in addition to the working stratum), impacting the manager-subordinate relationship. The exploratory proposition of the secondary question is whether MSR correlates strongly when the manager’s role is one stratum higher than the subordinate’s role and the manager’s current potential capability (CPC) corresponds with the manager’s role stratum, and the subordinate’s current potential capability corresponds with the subordinate’s role stratum. The author believes it is possible to test the primary research question, and thus, test this aspect of the theory (this proposition has not been tested). Furthermore, the secondary question could potentially advance the theory relating capabilities of managers and subordinates to their working strata.

Title: Agricultural Innovations in Turkey 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The adoption of agricultural innovations is crucial for economic growth as well as economic development. However, in order to help leverage the adoption and diffusion of innovative practices, it is important to understand the process of agricultural innovation and its determinants. Using data derived from interviews, published materials, and observations, this study identifies the key factors that determine agricultural innovations in Turkey. Based on these insights, the paper identifies the characteristics of innovative farmers and suggests policy strategies to encourage agricultural innovations. The analysis shows that agricultural innovations are taking place in Turkey and various public and private stakeholders contribute to the development and adoption of innovation in agriculture. Agricultural enterprises and cooperatives, clusters of innovation, non-governmental organizations, research institutes, government, and international institutions play an important part in the collaborative effort to create and disseminate innovation. In this context, the right institutional incentives, good governance, and an enabling infrastructure are crucial for the facilitation of innovation. The diffusion of innovations through extension services and experts promotes the active participation of farmers and may also have a positive impact on agricultural trade through increasing global competitiveness. Innovative agricultural products not only generate increasing returns for the existing demand for these products, but can increase competitiveness internationally. Since agriculture is mostly associated with a low-margin commodities business with decreasing returns, the potential of innovation in agriculture in making the rural sector more competitive and at the same time more sustainable has been underestimated.

Title: Great East Japan Earthquake – Implications for Agriculture, Food Industries and Consumption 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: On March 11, 2011 the strongest ever recorded in Japan earthquake occurred which triggered a powerful tsunami and caused a nuclear accident in one of the world’s largest nuclear plant stations. The triple disaster has been having immense impacts on people’s life, health and property, social infrastructure, economy, policies, natural and institutional environment, etc. in the affected regions, Japan, and beyond. This book tries to make a comprehensive assessment on the multiple impacts of the March 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, tsunami and Fukushima nuclear accident on the Japanese agriculture and food sector. It identifies and evaluates radiation, displacement, health, physiological, production, economic, technological, organizational, environmental, institutional, political, etc. impacts of the disasters in all stages (inputs supply, farming, storage, wholesaling, transportation, processing, distribution, retailing, consumption) and components (natural resources, labor, biological and material assets, intangibles, technology, production structure, finance, waste disposal, information, management) of agri-food chain, and temporal (immediate, short-term, long-term) and spacial (local, regional, national, trans-national) scales. It summarizes responses of individuals, households, farms, businesses, communities, consumers, stakeholders, and authorities as well as assesses the progress and challenges in the post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. The book withdraws lessons from the Japanese experiences and suggests recommendations for effective risk management in Japan and around the globe. The study is based on a wide range of information from governmental, academic, farmers, industry, international, etc. organizations, media, experts assessments and in-deep interviews with leading experts, stakeholders, and affected agents. Findings are presented in a popular way in order to reach a larger audience of researchers, educators, students, experts, farmers, businessmen, administrators, policy makers, professionals, non-governmental and international organizations, consumers, victims, and public at large.

Abstract: This book inspects the interdependencies among social disruption signals and their relationship to economic conditions as emerging from available Portuguese time series. Comparisons with international cross-section evidence are provided. Three types of innovations are presented: firstly, it searches for interactions – and common causes – between indicators of general aggressiveness or pro-activity that include accident, suicide, divorce rates and armed forces along with criminality records. Secondly, it illustrates theoretical applications of principal components: in time series filtering; in cross-correlation and corresponding significance-level probabilities analysis; in the treatment of missing cases. Finally, estimators based on observational replicability of second moments are proposed.

No great skill is needed to analyse these distributions. Indeed, there is even no need to analyse them mathematically. Reliable conclusions can be reached just by using different plots of data. However, mathematical analysis, which is simple and easy, helps in a better understanding of the mechanism of growth.

Title: Entropy 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: In this collection of papers, it shown that the “order”which is generated around us by evolution and the results of our doing can be explained by the propensity of entropy to increase; namely, by the second law of thermodynamics. Entropy is conceived by many as a disorder, however, that is true only for spares systems. In a dense system, entropy is information thatis characterized by a long tail distribution. In order to apply the second law to sociology and economy, we have to define a sociological net. With analogy to the internet, in which, in principle, every site can receive and broadcast information to any other site we can describe economic network as a group of bank accounts that each one of them canreceive or pay money to any other account. The distribution of links between the sites is similar to that of money in the bank accounts. This long tail distribution,whichis obtained by maximizing the entropy of the net, is called Planck-Benford distribution. It is also shown that Planck-Benford distribution can predict polls distribution;Gini inequality Index in the OECD countries;the percentage of the relative poverty; the salaries of the CEO’s relative to the average salaries and the number of employees. Moreover, the Planck-Benford income distribution, being an equilibrium distribution (Max Entropy),can provide a standard tool for estimatingthe stability of the economy of a given country namely closer the income distribution of a country to Planck Benford distribution closer the economy to equilibrium.

Title: Analysis of War on Terror Intensification Years in Pakistan (2007- 2009) 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The years 2007-2009 have been one of the more volatile years in Pakistan’s recent political history. The regime of President Musharraf in 2007 was faced with many domestic challenges that included a wave of terrorism across Pakistan as an after math of Lal Mosque incident where state of Pakistan dealt with voices of dissent with force. Lal Mosque incident became the pre cursor for President Musharraf’s ouster in 2008 as his government became weaker when a nationwide movement of dissent over took the street popularly known as Lawyers movement. In 2008, Pakistan returned to a democratic state when Pakistan People’s Party was elected. However, the events of 2007 still haunted Pakistani economy and the echo of terrorism lasted for some time. Whereas the clamp down on extremist elements were also intensified as a state response. Pakistan was at War with extremism and the War on Terror that started in Afghanistan in 2002 had found its way into Pakistan. Pakistan army was instrumental in waging the fight against extremism that witnessed unprecedented violence in the country during (2007-2009). Nevertheless, these years’ mark events that suggest that there was a network of Al Qaida within the borders of Pakistan capable of working independently in the country. These War on Terror intensification years reversed most of the economic gains and economic achievements of Musharraf regime. Pakistan became a security state even after its return to democracy in 2008.  The travel advisories for Pakistan recommended foreigners to avoid visiting the country. Pakistan was further isolated internationally. External sector suffered significantly when exports witnessed a deep plunge. The economic growth rates halted to less than 1 percent of GDP from as high as 7 percent. This books in detail covers the events of terrorism in Pakistan in 2007 to 2009 period to give readers a comprehensive picture of how bad the situation had become in War on Terror intensification years. Then a detailed discussion is also carried out on Pakistan’s economy so that readers have detailed view of the economic costs that was born by Pakistani nation for their participation in War on Terror. These costs or not limited to loss of property but it also include loss of many precious lives including the life of former Prime Minister of Pakistan Benazir Bhutto.

Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This Chapter makes a literary analysis on the factors that impact economic development in Africa, under the approach of the foundations of institutional school of Thorstein Veblen. For reasons for study it follows that European colonial policy corrupts ethnic/cultural ties in Africa, as delimiting boundaries in areas with a diversity of people and, later, with the independence of African countries, European governments lift conditions for a new elite, now African and subjected to a mental structure for European, use the power for the benefit of a specific ethnic group, at the expense of other ethnic groups. Finally, this paper conducts an empirical analysis in panel by OLS and GMM, which points to the impact of corruption in African economic growth

Title: Employing Transgender in Organization: Workplace Discrimination Challenges 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The study explores the challenges an organization face when transgender persons are employed. One of the challenges is workplace discrimination issue against the transgender employees. Further, the role of transformational leadership has been examined in dealing with workplace discrimination issues. The study is based on qualitative analysis where in the validity and credibility of the study is ensured using data triangulation i.e. data is collected through unstructured interviews, participant observation and documents & pictures. Also, source triangulation i.e. different categories of respondents included 6 transgender employees, 6 other employees who works closely with transgender employees, 3 HR personnel, and the Executive Director Akhuwat. The study supports the role of transformational leadership in handling workplace discrimination. The values & principles, like respect and brotherhood are the core factors affecting the workplace discrimination against transgender employees. Especially, in absence of formalized HR policies and regulations, the values & principles plays a pivotal role. Such values of brotherhood and respect encourages the employees to hold a non-discriminatory organizational culture. Data shows the transgender employees are more hardworking, motivated, loyal and satisfied for merely being respected and recognized by the organization. This study of transgender employment experiences and the role of transformational leadership opens new lines of inquiry for understanding gender inequalities at work, and it builds on scholarship that combines political, social and economic approaches with transgender studies.

Title: Overview of Papua’s International Relations 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The boundary between Papua and Melanesia is a matter of doubt and uncertainty. To mention Papua is also Melanesia in it. Similarly to mention Melanesia also exist Papua in it. As Melanesia, Papua is a sense of pluralism because of the distinctive coloring of the inhabitants and ethnic groups as well as the domestic pattern in the Papua Land of Islands or Sub-Continental of New Guinea. There is a frame of doubt in which Papua is based on the islands or sub-continent of New Guinea. Melanesia is related to the islands of the Southwest Pacific, including New Guinea to the west, including the archipelago of Nusantara in this case Nusa Tenggara, Maluku and the Southern Philippines (Mindanau) which perhaps also Formosa, Thailand and Peninsula of Malaca. Although not perse true because when viewed from the perspective of linguistics take it in the region mentioned there is randomly developing languages belonging to Austronesian characteristiecs and Papuan Languages characteristiecs, which also spread over to Polynesia, Micronesia, Australia and perhaps Indonesia and New Zealand. So here’s where the base spans the boundaries of the doubt. Thus Papuanistic is used to concoct in Melanesia wilderness especially concerning Language Science or Linguistics where being Melanesianology intended specifically for the attachment of Anthropology Science. Though it is, does not really shorten the boundaries of the doubts about both performance, Melanesia and Papua. The discussion is meant to say, in Melanesia there is Papua on the one side while on the other side Papua is inheriting the distinction between the Melanesian Typical Austronesians scattered mingled with the Papuans in Melanesia. This is a working paper in Course of Social Science Theory at Advanced Study in Social Science Program Cenderawasih University Year 2014. Also as well as a continuation of my Dissertation at Cenderawasih University 2017 entitled “The Roadmap to the Revival of the Papuan Nation in West Papua: “A Peaceful Decision on the Restoration of the Self””, in particular Chapter 4.1 or in my Book parsed from my Dissertation under the title Recovery of Papua, Chapter II. The topics raised in this paper is the overlapping between the Study on Melanesia and the Study on Papua entitled: “Overlapping of Papuanistiecs and Melanesianology.” This article is exciting for works to continue in addition to being a reference for planners and policies actors towards the Papuan people in particular and generally Melanesia and other parts of Oceania (Polynesia and Micronesia) and even Autralia and Indonesia.

Title: Fiscal Policy Operation in Nigeria: Trends, Magnitude and Challenges 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The book is designed to highlight Nigeria’s fiscal policy operation since the oil boom of 1970s putting into cognizance various policies and programs initiated and implemented during the period. Specifically, the trending behaviour of fiscal policy variables – including government expenditure, public debt and public revenue are analysed. Public financial management and fiscal policy reforms are also discussed. Challenges of fiscal policy in Nigeria are also explained in this book. The book shows that since the 1970s, the Nigeria’s fiscal policy can be said to have lacked definite and clear objective as majority of times the objectives are too broad reflecting majorly macroeconomic goals. Fiscal policy of Nigeria is also characterized by rising government expenditure without corresponding increase in public revenue which had deteriorated the fiscal stability of the country resulting to higher inflation and fiscal deficit accompanied by large accumulation of debt. The ability of the country to implement counter-cyclical fiscal policy to address the fiscal imbalances is mostly constrained by fluctuation in oil price, administrative inefficiencies and irregularities in the budgetary process. Sadly, despite reforms and initiatives undertaken, it is observed that they are weakened by persistent political influences and unnecessary delays in formulation and implementation of policies which in turn affect their performances. Government fiscal policy needs to be re-considered by moving from broad fiscal policy to a specific fiscal policy that will consider the needs and demand of people and derive the fiscal policies from such considerations. This can be done by strengthening the existing bodies and institutions saddled with the responsibility of making fiscal policy so as to make them efficient and effective and accommodative to people’s needs through pro-poor policies and programmes.

Title: Local Development Dynamics 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This volume—which is a collection of published articles by the “Stra.Tech.Man Lab” research team—focuses on and examines the dynamics of local systems as the principal contributors to overall socioeconomic development. Our goal is to clarify that local development is a phenomenon that goes beyond the traditional regional analysis and the “conventional” neoclassical theorization of maximization; the dynamics of local development seems to belong in the evolutionary socioeconomic science. The evolutionary and trans-disciplinary approach to local development dynamics focuses on the examination of local-level phenomena while seeking to comprehend how local systems (local innovation environments, local business ecosystems, local clusters) shape their potential of innovation and competitiveness. In our perspective, the scientific discipline of local development studies how socioeconomic systems in today’s era of globalization innovate and compete in their different spatial articulations.In particular, the volume contains four articles:Local support mechanisms for entrepreneurship: The approach of local development and innovation institutionsThe purpose of this article is to examine the innovative potential of small and medium-sized enterprises, which starts primarily from the micro (firm) and meso (globalized sectors of economic activity and business ecosystems in regional configurations) levels of a socioeconomic system. In this context, we argue that a developmental economic policy is inadequate when it focuses exclusively on macro-environmental measures and quantities.

Abstract: This chapter evaluates Papua provincial assets which are not utilized or not optimally utilized in Integrated Economic Development Zone (KAPET) of Biak. Through a case study analysis, direct observation, direct interview and literature studies conducted in this research, we found that the KAPET of Biak assets which also are the Papua provincial government’s assets have not been consistently well maintained and protected. Several assets were unutilized and were abandoned.  Considering the great potentials of KAPET-Biak area which has cultural richness, rich resources area, strategic position in the middle of world economic growth triangle and on the hub of the global route for trading in pacific region.  It would be better to develop the KAPET-Biak and its assets for further zonal developmental concept in this more global world.  The provincial government and all stake holders can also develop and utilize several assets to be the part of research and educational center (LIPTEK Lab and office).Tiwit Forest Preservation is in need for Sponsorship: This may an action for celebrating corporate event, carbon offsetting, launching of a Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility action: the opportunities to plant a forest as close as possible to our clients and collaborators are legion.

Abstract: This volume presents some fundamental elements to the Stra.Tech.Man approach, which the author of this book tried to develop during the last few years. The main challenge of the Stra.Tech.Man approach is to synthesize interpretatively the analytical spheres of strategy, technology, and management, upon the effort of any socioeconomic organization to innovate, survive, and develop. The following chapters search to define and apply in particular the multiple applications of the Stra.Tech.Man concept. They use this approach as an analytical mechanism to perceive in the context of the current transformative phase of globalization the aspects of competitiveness, innovation, and change management.

Title: Studies of African Economies From Past to Future Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The Chapter investigated the transmission channels of monetary policy shocks on real per capita output in Nigeria for the period 1981 to 2017 using Vector Auto-regressive framework. The results of the impulse response functions showed that real per capita output, exchange rate, private sector credit and inflation responded heterogeneously to unexpected monetary shock and hence, provide a useful indicator for determining the effectiveness of monetary policy in the domestic economy. In the case of the forecast error variance decomposition the study revealed that shocks to monetary policy rate explained the largest variation in real per capita output followed by private sector credit and exchange rate. These shocks have a progressive impact on real per capita output except private sector credit, while the average contributions of shocks from equity price channel is below one percent. Therefore, the basic channels of monetary transmission are monetary policy rate, credit and exchange, while equity prices might not be a relevant channel of monetary policy innovation in Nigeria. Furthermore, the forecast error variance decomposition of inflation revealed that the sources of inflation are the monetary policy rate and private sector credit channel. The study therefore recommends that there should be judicious management of interest rate, credit and exchange rate policy to promote real per capita output in Nigeria.This Chapter identifies factors likely to explain business failure in the Cameroonian textile industry. A probit model based on a normality test provides a failure rate of about 54.45%, mainly explained as follows: companies with high operating expenses face an increase in their failure probability; associative or bank loan-based firms experience a high failure risk, unlike those created through equity, public grants and family support; high pricing practice compare to competitors increases the failure risk, contrary to low or average pricing modes; Formal work increases the failure risk while working in the informal significantly decreases this risk. Implementing tax and institutional reforms likely to encourage informal corporations to legally operate seems necessary to fight against unfair pricing behaviours.

Title: Studies on Southeastern Europe and the Greek Econom 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: We are experiencing a phase of profound restructuring of world capitalism. Several phenomena and developments lead us to observe a restructuring and crisis that take place upon the previous phase of globalization. In our view, the current global crisis is a socioeconomic “gameplay” of planetary reach, where the balanced and healthy reproduction of the past globalization is over. Moreover, we should notice that this theoretical approach cannot be a superficial or sporadic one but structural and systematic.The main conceptual thread of this book argues that, in every substantial contemporary approach to globalization, we must understand the particular historical/evolutionary nature of the global socioeconomic space in its unity. We must examine together, in their dialectical adaptation and co-evolution, all the dynamic dimensions: economic, technological, social, and geopolitical.In this context, the study of geo-economic and geopolitical dynamics in Southeastern Europe and Greece invites us to examine many partial dynamic dimensions. These dynamics unify the levels of spatial analysis (local, national, international, and global), competitiveness (articulated in micro-meso-macro level), and development (both in terms of firms, various sectors of economic activity, and business ecosystems).

Title: Economic Growth and Public Investment Optimality 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book investigates the relation between economic growth and public investment expenditures. It examines the level and means to improve the macroeconomic effectiveness of government investment spending and explores the concept of optimality under the constraint of debt sustainability. Additionally, this research analyzes the legislative and institutional factors that could slow down the effectiveness of investment expenditures, and provides hints on how the reduction of corruption could help fiscal policy converge toward optimality. The first chapter sheds light on economic growth in the literature as a core variable of the economic activity, its determinants and the role of investment, particularly public investment, as a potential contributor. The second chapter focuses on public investment’s macroeconomic effectiveness, as the first leg of optimality. The emphasis is laid on the examination of the macro-financial framework of Morocco as an example of developing countries, followed by a larger benchmark panel data model. Afterwards, I estimate public investment expenditures’ impact on GDP, along with other variables such as GFCF and public consumption. The third chapter introduces debt sustainability as the second component of public investment optimality. The twofold concept of optimality is then encompassed in an experimental small scale macroeconomic model for public investment policy analysis, on which a series of policy shocks is driven in order to further discuss different hypotheses. Throughout this book, I reveal that the macroeconomic impact of public investment expenditures is below the effectiveness levelhence could not logically be optimal even if public debt is found to be sustainable. Subsequently, a number of effectiveness-oriented institutional recommendations are prescribed. The policy simulation also suggests that an increase in public investment spending that is not totally or predominantly matched with a rise in public revenues has a larger and longer negative impact on public debt than a positive one on GDP growth. On overall, public investment’s optimality in the realistic framework of a developing economy seems to be strictly conditioned by a cumulative series of positive variations combined with the improvement of profitability-based selectivity of investment projects, under the constraint of a debt ratio that should not exceed 60 percent.

Abstract: How does technology evolve? The book confronts this question here by developing the theory of technological parasitism, which endeavors to analyze and explain, with a new perspective, the relationships supporting the evolution of complex systems of technology in society.This study is part of a large body of research on the evolution of technology started in 2016 at Arizona State University (Center for Social Dynamics and Complexity, Tempe AZ, USA), continued at Yale University in 2019 (School of medicine, New Haven CT, USA) and now is ongoing at National Research Council of Italy (Torino, Italy). This book is designed for students, undergraduates, graduates, managers in business and public administration, policymakers that wish to understand: critical characteristics of the evolution of technology, relationships between technologies in complex systems that clarify the driving forces of technical change, properties that explain which technologies are likely to evolve rapidly and, as well as also wish to expand their knowledge on these research fields that could aid management of firms and innovation strategy of nations to implement best practices of product/process design and development for supporting R&D investments, sustaining and safeguarding competitive advantage in markets

Abstract: In a situation of bank credit rationing, SMEs have the most recourse to short-term financing. In order of preference, these include tontines, microfinance institutions, business-to-business loans, carers, friends’ helpers, current associate competitions, leasing institutions, associations, and associations, increase in capital. This order corresponds almost to the most sought after alternative financing methods. There is therefore a financial equilibrium problem when it comes to meeting the long-term and medium-term needs of SMEs. To respond to this concern, we have proposed alternative financing methods to SMEs, specifying their order of preference, which SMEs can use in rationing bank credit. Other proposals for banks and public authorities have also been made to improve bank financing for SMEs.Cocoa activity in Meme Division for decades has greatly contributed in the organisation of rural population as well as landscape in the area. This is remarkable in the distribution patterns of local labour forces on cocoa farms after post colonial era. In similar way it has also influence the social, economic and political characteristics of local development in Meme Division since independence. Despite many opportunities from the activity the sector remains questionable. The chapter examines and analyses the contribution of cocoa production to local development in Meme Division as well as the nature of labour practices in the sector. A random sampling technique of one hundred and fifty (150) cocoa producing households in thirty villages was adopted. The issues raised by the respondents was statistically analysed after investigation. Results show that cocoa production is one of the sources of national and households’ income. It has also accounted for the development of solidarity farm working groups. From which four labour patterns are created: family, hired, force, and voluntary labours. These solidarity groups are mostly youth representing 60% of labour force as against 40% for adults’ workers on cocoa activities. Conclusion shows that Meme Division is the best sample to evaluate the role of cocoa activity in the organisation of local population, labour distribution pattern on cocoa sector as well as local development.

Title: Studies of African Economies From Past to Future Vol.3 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Financial statements have become important sources of information about company performance in order to assess its financial stability and potential growth. However, additional information may be hidden on the interpretation in the values contained by financial statements. The study aims to assess financial performance with a case study of a company listed in the Johannesburg Stock Exchange utilizing financial statements and further investigate whether companies present their results precisely. The study intends to conduct an analysis on a company competitive positioning, valuation and financial stability. The results indicated that this case study’s financial statement could be beneficial for assessment of company performance.African nations share a common situation in that they pollute little in terms of CO2s globally speaking, but at the same time global warming will likely have terrible consequences for the continent, set to face a sharp population increase. They have now access to few energy resources, which is conducive to their poverty. New renewables belong to the future (solar, wind, geo-thermal), whereas old renewables -wood, coal-– are a thing of the past. The coal or oil and gas dependent giants must start energy transformation, as must the many countries relying upon traditional biomass, or charcoal. The use of wood coal is simply too large for the survival of the African forests. Africa need lots of energy to handle the coming crisis ofpotable water, as lakes and rivers are shrinking and degraded by pollution, dams and overfishing.

Abstract: There is tolerance merger of Unity in Diversity versus solidarity merger of Togetherness in Diversity as poles of spanning the natural and engineering efforts are not natural to make or maintain existing fused together. Shown by the spirit of Indonesia’s 1945 Constitution versus Papua’s 1999 Constitution. This article titled “Constitution vis-à-vis Constitution: Indonesia 1945 versus Papua 1999” is intended to demonstrate the existence of each of the philosophical as well as the feasibility of correlation between the two as cause and effect in supporting the blare political action which is: “The Roadmap to the Revival of the Papuan Nation in West Papua: “A Peaceful Decision on the Restoration of the Self”. Affair have been taken place, namely through the Third Papua People’s Congress (Kongres Rakyat Papua Tiga/KRP-3), October 16-19, 2011, where the Nation of Papua has announced Unilateral Declaration of Independence of the Nation of West Papua/UDI-Papua and formation of The Federal Republic of West Papua/FRPB (Negara Republik Federal Papua Barat/ NRFPB) back to and continuing the Political Status of December 27nd 1949 to December 1st, 1961 (after RTC of The Hague to Political Manifesto of Papua). This is the status before Papua being occupied by Indonesia at change of International conspiracy. Thus, as well as to formulate the two basics: First, how to understand the presence of Papua-Melanesian inhabiting Land of Papua? Second, whether, People of Papua-Melanesian and Indonesia who inhabiting Land of Papua can beeing together according to the federalist order of Papua-Melanesian? This may also potentially for other basic formulation of discussion likely to reveal a back-rock (the unshakeeable basis) of each of the existence which is of Papua and of Indonesia as two different nations. The two nations are, as being correlated in the process of time and idealism. The appearance of actual and accurate Papua in Indonesia because of the synergies and mechanisms of critically adhesives of interest to tolerate incorporation of national unity or Multiple-wide but One, but also at the same time hard spanned cohesive because there is no solidarity which is Togetherness in Diversity because the nature of rejecting merger. There are many hidden presence but there are also some blatant. For this reason hidden structure theory needs to be implementing which convergent with other theories in the phenomenology-behaviourism methodology with the support of literature and empirical studies in practice (auto-ethnography). Thus it can be understood that there is tolerance merger of Unity in Diversity versus solidarity of Togetherness in Diversity is poles of spanning the natural and engineering efforts which are not natural to make or maintain existing fused together. The idealism reflected in each constitution of the two nations which are 1945 Constitution of Indonesia versus 1999 Constitution of Papua.

Title: Socio-Economic Issues in Cameroon Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This chapter highlights the various corrupt practices between applicants and educational staff during examinations / competitive exams in order to succeed in the Cameroon educational system. An odds ratios Analysis from the supply side revealed that in most of the regions studied, the magnitude of the payment of bribes to school leaders for success (Director / Principal) as compared to that of their employees is about 2.62 times higher. In the same vein, our estimates show that in about 70.8% of cases, the leaders of these institutions are the most needed in recommending candidates for their success in various exams. We highlighted from the demand side the characteristics of examinees through a Bernoulli distribution; it appears that the non-poor, women, the youngest and workers are the categories of people who are most vulnerable to corrupt practices.This chapter is a continuation of our previous works on the determinants of multiple jobs of lecturers in Cameroonian State universities. It lays particular emphasis on human resource management used in these universities. The methodology makes use of the logit analysis on survey data. The results obtained show that contrary to the theoretical and empirical literature, time constraint in the main job does not appear to be an important explanatory factor for the multiple jobs phenomenon. However, gender, the universities’ location, salary earned from secondary jobs and the holding of an administrative position in a university play a major role in explaining the phenomenon. This paper thus presents a certain interest linked to the specificity of these jobs (lack of monitoring, opportunism in behaviors, social pressures related to them) on the one hand, and the coaching of the human resource used on the other. Governmental incentive measures are proposed to limit this dual employment phenomenon which tends to deteriorate the quality of lectures provided.

Title: The Effects of Government Stock on Investment Activity in BRICS Countries 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) are distinguished as having the fast growing markets in the universe compared to other markets of emerging economies, according to their promising economic prospective and demographic power. This study investigated the effects of government stock on investment activity in BRICS countries. This study used panel autoregressive distributed lag model (PARDL), Engel-Granger causality test, impulse response functions (IRF) and variance decomposition tests. Such techniques were applied to the annual data for the periods 2001 to 2016 in order to determine the effects of government stock on investment activity. The PARDL showed that in the long-run investment activity was positively influenced by government stock on mutual banks and government stock on liquid assets, and negatively related to government stock on bonds and government stock on corporations. The Engel-Granger causality test revealed existence of unidirectional movement between investment activity and government stock on corporations as well as from government stock on bonds to liquid assets. The impulse response functions showed the impulse percentage of fluctuation that the variables did contribute to each other, from various periods both in the short and long run. While the variance decomposition of investment indicated that investment was mainly shocked by its own innovations throughout all the periods. A critical evaluation is needed to avoid investment shocks, instability of investment activity, instability of financial markets and the economy as a whole.

Title: Health and Hospital Economics 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This Chapter analyzes and highlights the most practised forms of corruption in public hospitals of Douala metropolis in Cameroon, namely corruption with theft and that without theft. The results of our analyzes show a predominance of the form without theft, this regardless of the hospital, and this allowed us to classify hospitals based on the dominant form. It appears that the General and Deido Hospitals are health facilities where corruption without theft is the least and the most practiced respectively, while the Cité des Palmiers and New Bell hospitals are those where corruption with theft is the least and the most practiced. An estimate through odds ratios revealed for instance that the odds would be about 5.46 times higher that the form without theft is not practiced at the General hospital compared to other hospitals, and about 11.11 times that it is practiced at Deido hospital compared to all hospitalsh.The problem that arises is how the State official in a monopoly situation maximizes the value of bribes collected, by selling public services to users? To answer this question, we show that the State agent in a monopoly situation can discriminate users according to their characteristics in order to collect more possible bribes. The Shleifer and Vishny’ simple monopoly model is therefore limited. The survey of patients of nine public hospitals in Douala revealed the existence of two forms of corruption at consultation: corruption without theft and corruption with theft. An evaluation of maximizing the earnings of medical doctors using odds ratios, showed that in the pursuit of these gains and whatever the form of corruption practiced, the State agent plays not only on amounts of bribes paid, but also on users’ characteristics. However, for amounts between 3,000 FCFA and 5,000 FCFA, our results revealed that the doctor will tend to practice the form of corruption without theft on men, the wealthiest, the learned and the old where he/she would draw the greatest possible gain.

Title:  New Globalization Dynamics 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: We are experiencing a phase of profound restructuring of globalization nowadays, manifested through a wide variety of crisis symptoms, articulated at the same time upon the economic, political, social, and environmental spheres. Everything shows that the movements of the world’s “tectonic plates” are re-shaping the existing geo-economic and geopolitical balances on the planet drastically, causing new challenges to emerge, as well as new opportunities and threats for all stakeholders and participants in the global socioeconomic system.Therefore, the current global crisis and restructuring are taking shape within a precarious state of affairs. In virtually every corner of the globe and an expanding number of cases and situations—both directly and visibly, both indirectly and subversively—old problems seem to return and become more challenging than yesterday. At the same time, new socioeconomic issues emerge and spread rapidly, without making it possible to find and implement effective, sustainable, and generalized long-term solutions on a global scale.

Title: New Patterns of Technological Evolution Theory and Practice 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: In 2009, Brian Arthur claimed that one of the most important problems to understand regarding technology is to explain how it evolves (p.15ff). In fact, the evolution of technology plays an important role in the economic and social change of human societies. Technological evolution as a main process of technical change has been compared to biological evolution by many scholars. The similarities between biological and technological evolution have generated a considerable literature. Wagner & Rosenargued that biological thinking has reduced the distance between life sciences and social sciences. Basalla, suggested that the history of technology can profitably be seen as analogous to biological evolution. Technological evolution, alongside biological evolution, displays radiations, stasis, extinctions, and novelty. In general, patterns of technological innovation emerge and evolve with technological paradigms and trajectories in specific economic, institutional and social environments. Hosler argues that the development of technology is, at least to some extent, influenced by “technical choices”, which express social and political factors, and “technical requirements”, imposed by material properties. Arthur & Polak claim that: “Technology … evolves by constructing new devices and methods from ones that previously exist, and in turn offering these as possible components—building blocks—for the construction of further new devices and elements”. In particular, Arthur, argues that the evolution of technology is due to combinatorial evolution: “Technologies somehow must come into being as fresh combinations of what already exists.” This combination of components and assemblies is organized into systems or modules to some human purpose and has a hierarchical and recursive structure. Other scholars suggest that technological evolution is driven by solving consequential problems during the engineering process and by supporting leadership of distinct purposeful organizations —for instance firms— to achieve the prospect of a (temporary) profit monopoly and/or competitive advantage.

Title: Behavioural Finance: Reviews on EuroZone and Brexit 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: After five years of research into the hot debated and my chosen topic of behavioural finance, it has become obvious that the field is a major area of studies. Over the years I have tried to provide empirical evidence that markets do tend to follow trends set by theories of behavioural finance. The evidence I presented surround the key events since the millennium; events such as the introduction of the euro, the global financial and eurozone sovereign debt crises and Brexit. As can be seen from these events, I have tended to mainly concentrate on the reaction of market participants in the European Union.The Introduction of the Euro and Eurozone Financial Markets Integration.The introduction of the euro was and still is one of the financial events of the last few decades. I was working as a software engineer at IBM at the time, the topic of the day was how will the introduction of the euro effect the transactions of many financial institutions. By the mid-2000s, I was doing an MSc in financial Management and decided to do my dissertation on the euro. By then the Euro has established itself as one of the major currencies and many thought it would challenge the US dollar. However, by the end of the 2000s the tide was beginning to turn as the weaknesses of the European monetary union were highlighted first by the recession which followed the financial crisis and then the sovereign debt crisis. These events led to a rise in nationalist tendencies across the eurozone. Funnily enough while I was writing my paper which forms chapter of this book, a dear friend and old lecturer of mines suggested I call it Happy 20th Anniversary Euro: from shining beacon of hope to ticking time bomb.

Title: Studies of African Economies From Past to Future Vol.4 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This chapter assesses the impact of road infrastructure investments on the structural competitiveness of Burkina Faso’s economy. After retaining the period from 1980 to 2015, the estimate of the Model to Error Correction (ECM) revealed that investment in road infrastructure positively and significantly affects the structural competitiveness of the economy. However, this incidence varies over time. In fact, the elasticity of structural competitiveness compared to road investments is 0.06 in the short term and 0.32 in the long term. In view of these results, it appears that the implication of economic policy that emerges is that an increase in investment in road infrastructure is a policy of gaining structural competitiveness of the country’s economy.Natural resource redistribution and ownership transfer programs are introduced as a way of improving income distribution and alleviating poverty in rural areas of most developing countries. In the case of South Africa, these redistributive policies are implemented in line with the national development plan targeting extreme poverty alleviation and reduction of wide income disparities by 2030. This paper analyses the distributive effects of the land redistribution policy which is a shock in the agriculture sector on poor household income in South Africa by applying a multiplier decomposition and structural path analysis. The study contributes to the existing literature by providing a microscopic analysis of the global multiplier to show the transmission mechanism of household income from a shock into the agriculture sector and show how income moves across sectors, factors and households by dividing the multiplier effects into all its components. The results showed that poor households received higher direct effects and the rich households received high indirect effects from the shock in the agricultural sector. The structural path shows that a significant portion of the global influence of the shock in agriculture is transmitted through the path of factor income which in turn increases poor household income.

Title: Economics: Demand, Supply, The Market, and Business 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book concentrates on the elementary micro-economics, both theory and applied. The purpose is to produce a relatively portable text covering micro-economics at an elementary level in sufficient details. This supplements related materials in more complete texts but that fail on details. This portability and supplementation properties rationalises the need of the text.After the introductory remarks in chapter one, the text takes an elementary approach to the theoretical basis of supply and demand in the second chapter and production in the third chapter. The treatment of imperfect competition in chapter four is typically slightly more complicated but nonetheless still elementary. The last chapter is an application of the earlier chapters both in a micro and macro sense or setting.The last chapter is rather unique, not commonly found in texts of this nature which from chapter four would go into macro-economics, often starting with national income. In this way, the text does provide an opportunity of applying the micro foundations to the business world albeit in an elementary setting.The primary audience of this book is the student community in the early stages of the discipline. Practitioners and policy makers would find it useful as a backdrop.

Title: Global Crisis and Restructuring Theory, analysis, and the case of Greece 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: his book examines the global restructuring since its appearance from the late 2000s to the present. It tries to describe and explore the fundamental dimensions of the phenomenon of the current crisis and repositioning of the global socioeconomic system by following an analytical perspective that exceeds a “conjunctural” perspective. It counter-proposes a view of examining the contemporary historical configurations of globalization dynamics in structural and evolutionary terms. Finally, it considers that a valid perception of the current global restructuring requires the simultaneous co-examination of adaptation, innovation, and change management of the partial socioeconomic organizations, sectors of economic activity, and overall socioeconomic systems, at all the “organically linked” levels of space: local, national, international, and global.

Title: Knowledge transfer, multinational enterprises, organizational learning 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book aims to explore one of the most important aspects of knowledge management, knowledge transfer in multinational enterprises (MNEs). It examines this knowledge transfer process from two distinct perspectives: intra-firm and inter-firm. Intra-firm transfer of knowledge refers to the knowledge flow between headquarters and subsidiaries and inter-firm transfer is defined as the knowledge transfer between partners in international joint-ventures (IJV). Specifically, it attempts to investigate the factors that influence the intra-firm knowledge transfer process and the willingness to share knowledge between partners in IJVs, in order to improve the performance of MNEs. Since willingness to share knowledge between partners is more complex than that between parent and subsidiary due to the difference in ownership structure, if MNEs can manage the willingness to share knowledge in IJVs, then dealing with it between parent and subsidiary should be much easier.To examine intra-firm knowledge transfer, system dynamics (SD) modeling is adopted and simulations demonstrate that both the transmission willingness and capacity, and absorptive willingness and capacity are important for MNEs to enhance its performance, since knowledge transfer is a two-way communication process. In order to reach a win-win situation, both headquarters and subsidiaries should be willing to share knowledge and learn from each other. To improve the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, ways to enhance transmission willingness and absorptive capacity, and cultural factors that influence cross-border communication are explored and discussed.

Title: Wealth and Growth: with Portugal case 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This chapter explores the dynamic potential of point-wise utility functions optimization of representative agent economies. Such functions were generically considered to depend upon current consumption and wealth to be made available for next period usage or income generation, implying an endogenous (pseudo-)rate of time preference. At first inspection, the framework reproduced closely the dynamics and steady-state properties of the traditional Solow-Swan and Ramsey models – with population growth, exogenous technical progress, land, or increasing returns to scale – as well as, when human capital/knowledge was introduced, the Lucas-Uzawa endogenous growth set-up. General uncertainty – simulated at different decision stages – resulted in intuitively appealing solutions. Overlapping optimization of the capital stock generated forward-looking recursive dynamics. Homothetic preferences (CES or generalized Cobb-Douglas) – implying a constant consumption-(lead)wealth ratio along an optimal path and resulting in steady-state saving rates independent of CRS technologies features in simple structures -, were assumed for illustration, and also generic separable forms in the arguments. The latter were useful under uncertainty, allowing the inspection of the role of risk-aversion and diminishing marginal returns to capital in equilibrium and steady-state determination.This chapter extends the standard closed shop union model of wage determination by introducing endogeneity of union membership. The labor market outcome with endogenous membership may differ when unions behave monopsonisticaly relative to the case where they are “membership-takers”, resulting in higher or lower wages (more or less favorable contract curve in efficient bargaining) according to the form union´s utility function and/or implicit decision process value union size. Some notes are added highlighting the role of membership fees in the membership function determination of a union that works as a nonprofit organization.

Title: Rational Expectations and Rational Expressive Behavior 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: How to understand human activities and behavior, or, more generally, the ethical nature of human existence itself, is a question that has long been a subject of debate among sociologists and economists alike. It is the question that has divided the two camps while guiding us toward a deeper understanding of our activities as agents of multiple orientations.  This book presents my work on two themes about the ethical nature of human existence as spontaneous activities in relation to the environing world that this existence reveals to itself. Our first theme deals with human existence as socio-cultural agents who seek symbolic profits under a system of cultural symbolism and value patterns/norms, and the other deals with human existence as economic agents who seek economic profits under a system of relations that define the market equilibrium.There is a close affinity between these two facets. Our activities as socio-cultural agents are anchored in a system of cultural symbolism and value patterns that are internalized in our institutionalized dispositions. As such agents, we seek symbolic profits by expressing our choices systematically in reference to this system. The rationality of such expressive behavior should, therefore, be as dictating and sensible as the rationality of seeking economic profits. The point we make is that expressive behavior would not be possible in a vacuum, that is, without some externally given sources of value patterns and symbolism with which to express our choices. This entails that socio-cultural choice behavior is intertwined with these sources that we discover in an environing world through our own existence as socio-cultural agents. Specifically, the behavior expresses itself as a consistent norm-guided behavior that helps reproduce the same norms and value patterns and maintain the symbolic nature of our activities. Furthermore, such norm-guided behavior is not independent of the conditions of the bounded rationality in the sense that it helps reduce the cost of decision making and problem-solving, thereby serving as powerful heuristics that simplify otherwise complex problem-solving and lead to the attainment of symbolic profits at the same time. It is equally an important source of predictive and predictable behavior.

Title: Economic growth, industrialization and macroeconomic analysis on Africa 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This chapter (I) aims to study the impact of remittances from African migrants on their home countries’ growth and development. These funds constitute a steadily increasing financing means in all these countries, even though development aid is still the preferred financing method. To highlight the role of these funds, we relied on a number of experiences as far as their targets and uses are concerned. Globally speaking, stylized facts based on case studies show that remittances have a positive impact on migrants’ home countries’ economies. In particular, they reduce household poverty and thereby increase their well-being. In addition, they stimulate local economic activity and growth. Given the role and stability of these funds, cost reduction is essential to encourage migrants to send more money through official transfer channels. It is also necessary to increase the managerial efficiency of these funds by orienting them towards implementing profitable projects, rather than devoting them entirely to household consumption. Lastly, it is necessary to encourage the capture of related financial flows by the traditional banking system and microfinance institutionsThis chapter (II) showed that industrialisation by substitution of imports has been a failure in Africa and has made industries in this part of the world less competitive on the foreign market. As such, a different industrialisation strategy which in the context of globalisation of economies and the fierce competition of the international market reinforces the competitiveness of African countries. This new strategy was translated amongst others by the appropriation of new technologies, protection of infant industries, cloning of manufactured products imported out of Africa, regional integration and the culture of exporting manufactured products.This chapter (III) examines the different strategies required for the sustainability of sub-Sahara Africa’s external debt by applying the Simonsen criterion and the conditions of the Harrod-Domar debt and growth model. We then suggest that for debt to be sustainable the financial ratios have to be respected. So the effective servicing of the external debt in Sub-Saharan Africa requires that the expenses incurred in reducing poverty should be known. If the difference between the net returns and the expenses incurred in fighting against poverty is negative this reduces the burden of the debt. Finally, we recommend that Sub-Saharan African countries should use a combination of strategies based on sustainable development, financial resources of the government, and regulatory and institutional norms to manage their debts sustainably.

Title: Applied Cross-Sectional Econometrics 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The project to write a book on applied Econometrics when I was granted with the Econometrics II course to teach to MPhil Economics, the contents of this book were developed from the lecture material which is competitive to course contents of The University of Edinburgh UK, a university where I did MSc in Economics, exploring other books, personal experience and the critical discussion by the students. The variety of contents which this book covers meet no competition with other universities in the city.
This book is an attempt to provide straight forward application based illustration of popular econometric models which are popular and available in the literature. I started this work with the idea that a research practitioner who is not versed with the basics of mathematics and statistics. He might not be able to understand the complex econometric model. This book provides firstly with some background to the model regarding what are the conditions which lead to this model selection. Secondly, basic mathematical derivations which are necessary for the concept. Lastly, STATA software-based example and its interpretation. The approach this book uses it that it delivers the concepts of the econometric models as well as it provides guidelines to use the STATA software using coding.This book is especially designed for the MPhil / PhD students of all social science disciplines. And researchers who want to avail the skills of latest econometric models to be used in subjects like Sociology, Psychology, Finance and Banking.

Title: Studies of African Economies From Past to Future Vol.5 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to determine the gender wage gap in the informal sector in Togo. To do so, the method of decomposition of the refocused influence function (RIF) was applied to data from the integrated regional survey on employment and the informal sector (ERI-ESI) in WAEMU member states carried out by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic and Demographic Studies (INSEED) in Togo (2019). The results reveal that men are better paid than women throughout the wage distribution. This gender wage gap is mainly due to differences in performance associated with productive characteristics. In addition, discrimination against women has increased in the low and medium quantiles, i.e. it has affected the poorest disproportionately. These results imply that in order to effectively combat the wage gap in the informal market in Togo, emphasis must be placed on those factors that explain the wage difference, namely education, experience and sector of activity. The paper seeks to examine the way subsistence housing has become a challenge to Dar es Salaam city’s competitiveness. A literature review and conducting interviews were the methods used to collect data.  Findings indicate that there is large quantity of subsistence housing in Dar es Salaam. The situation has reduced the high degree of urban competitiveness in a number of ways, which include increased productivity, improvement of the life of its citizens, as well as providing higher quality of social services. The paper argues for the improvement of subsistence housing by involving central and local governments, private sector, civil society organizations, the community and the international organizations to work in partnershipin order to increase the city’s competitiveness.

Abstract: (Ch.1) The aim of this chapter is to try to explain governance failures in Sub-Saharan Africa and to identify reforms which can lead to good governance. The failures are mainly due to institutions that do not work properly, corruption, and lack of real democracy. Governance reforms can be both institutional and political. The political reforms should promote and reinforce democratic practices. Institutions should guarantee the rule of law and limit the elite’s economic and political power.(Ch.2) This chapter addresses in details the basic concept of time series and predicting them with the use of Box – Jenkins Methodology multi-variables. The study aims at using the Methodology of Box – Jenkins in predicting estimating and analyzing the economic variables specifying the rate of exchange in Sudan during the period 1975 – 2019 with entering these variables in the estimated model, the study made use of the descriptive Methodology for analysis and the statistical methodology in realizing its objectives and the (SPSS25, NCSS20, MINITAB16, E_views10). The study conclude that the time series is the best methods for prediction in general, and the methodology of Box – Jenkins of multi- variables in particular, and in stability and (stationary) of the time series is due to the existence of the random orientation and the nature of the random indicatives of macro-economics in their environment. The proper model of the study is (ARIMA 2.1.1) according to Box – Jenkins Methodology (the multi variables one). The study concluded with to the quality and suitability of the models of (ARIMA 2.1.1) the multi-variables in predicting the rate of exchange and the specified variables. The study recommended the followings. To strive to find date base that meets all the needs of ministry of finance and National economics and the research and statistic administration at the central Bank of  Sudan, and the necessity to give full care to statistical, econometrics and predictive studies regarding the different economic phenomena. The economic sector at (the Ministry of finance and National economy and the central bank of Sudan should use the model of (ARIMA 2.1.1) in predicting the rate of exchange in future accompanied with specified economic indicatives in the Models.

Title: Understanding a Company for Value Investing Business Efficiency, Business Effectiveness, Innovativeness, Sustainability 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Teaching courses on Financial Management, Security Analysis and Portfolio Management, Corporate Finance and Critical Analysis of Organizations requires reference to profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of companies. The last course that I have been teaching over the years also refers to qualitative traits of companies like strategy, vision and leadership qualities. Reading annual reports of companies is essential to appreciate the above mentioned courses and in Calcutta Business School we inculcate this habit among our students. This also helps in delivering lectures in Marketing, Operations Management and Human Resource Management. It is very difficult to develop appreciation of a company, if a student does not read annual reports of companies.Tracking performance of companies over time requires metrics of measurement, and the book emphasizes throughout the need for such metrics. The book divides the performance of companies under the heads of business efficiency, business effectiveness, innovativeness and sustainability and metrics under each of the heads are defined. Even to understand qualitative traits of companies, metrics are defined.

Title: Currency Boards – Vol.1 Theory and Policy 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: In 1995, I founded the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise. One of the purposes of that research institute was to continue a research program on currency board systems, which was established in the early 1980s. The program has included the works of many leading experts on currency boards and has benefitted enormously from the involvement of my former post-doctoral student and long-time collaborator Dr. Kurt Schuler.Many of the papers in this volume focus on various aspects of currency boards. They are original because they are based on primary data. Indeed, the Johns Hopkins research program on currency boards, which is directed by Dr. Schuler and me, has now collected and digitized all of the financial data for virtually all of the currency boards that have ever existed. So, just what is a currency board?An orthodox currency board issues notes and coins convertible on demand into a foreign anchor currency at a fixed rate of exchange. As reserves, it holds low-risk, interest-bearing bonds denominated in the anchor currency and typically some gold. The reserve levels (both floors and ceilings) are set by law and are equal to 100%, or slightly more, of its monetary liabilities (notes, coins, and, if permitted, deposits). A currency board’s convertibility and foreign reserve cover requirements do not extend to deposits at commercial banks or to any other financial assets. A currency board generates profits (seigniorage) from the difference between the interest it earns on its reserve assets and the expense of maintaining its liabilities.

Title: Socio-Economic Issues in Cameroon, Vol.3 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Child mortality is an important demographic, health, and development. It is for this reason therefore that the reduction in child mortality is a worldwide target, and was one of the most important key indicators in the Sustainable Development Goals and has been reconsidered as vital in the recent Millennium Development Goals. Following this, this paper attempt to assess the drivers of child mortality in Cameroon using the 2011 Cameroon Demographic Health Survey data collected by the National Institute of Statistics (NIS).To assess the effect of safe drinking water on child mortality in Cameroon. Specifically, the study scrutinises: (a)   the effect of safe drinking water on child mortality (b) the effects of the number of bed nets in a household, (c) the effects of the number of births in the past years on child mortality. To attain these objectives, we employ a probit model as the dependent variable, child mortality, is dichotomous in nature. Among the several results, the data revealed that, (a) access to safe drinking water reduces the chances of a child dying, (b) the number of bed nets in the household is important in reducing child mortality and (c) the fewer the number of births in the past year, the lesser the number of children a woman will loss during pregnancy and child birth. This has policy implication if child mortality must be reduced. Commercial agriculture is one of the fundamental catalysts for socio economic development and spatial transformations of space. Oil palm production is amongst the activities carried out in Mamfe Sub-division and today it is perceived as the panacea to rural development even though unsatisfactory. The paper examines the production of oil palm and its contribution to rural development in Mamfe Sub-division. In order to attain this objective a systematic random sampling of 350 oil palm producing households from 8 villages in the Sub-division constituted the sample frame. Data collected from the field were treated and analyzed statistically with the use of cartographic soft-wares: CorelDraw12, MapInfo, Microsoft Excel and results were presented on tables, figures and photos. The main results are: Findings revealed that favorable ecological conditions in terms of sandy soils and temperatures that range between 26○C to 29○C, and rainfall that also oscillate from 1500 to 2000mm are pre-conditions for oil palm production. This is complemented with dynamics of energetic youthful population that ensure the survival of the activity in Mamfe. The second result demonstrates that there are two types of oil palm cultivated concentrated in zones according to species: improved specie (Tenera) and un-improved specie (Dura) these zones of segregation are easily noticed among the farmers of peasant populations of Mamfe Sub-division. Generally, the un-improve specie out-weighs the improved species of palms cultivated in the area.               The third findings shows that the peasants derived much income from palms activity and this permit them to construct private residents, about 70% of the 350 oil palm farmers sampled own their own houses in which they live in and close to 60% of the peasants own block houses, send their children to school and their standard of living is improved owing to the provision of protein food. Local development in Mamfe Sub-division is reflected in the evolution of the activity based on villages’ development. The fourth and last results depicts that the contribution of oil palm production to socio economic development is unsatisfactory because it is plague by several problems amongst which include, neglect by elites, inadequate capital etc. The temporal closure of the lone oil palm cooperative; MOPCOOP due to succession crisis is partly responsible for the unsatisfactory oil palm production and socio economic development in Mamfe Sub-division. This article proposes the reinstatement of MOPCOOP amongst other measures; this structure is considered as a corner-stone to the development of the sub-sector.

Title: Studies on the Sovereign Debt Market 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The Sovereign Debt Market is an essential section of the global financial market. In essence it is the main route for governments to cover any fiscal deficit in their budget. As of end of 2018, the market was US$188 trillion according to the IMF report on 17 December 2019. The market was long regarded as a safe haven for investors, especially the US treasuries and German Bunds. However in recent years the market has suffered several crises leaving investors questioning their high quality ratings. In this book we look at the efficiency and stability of the sovereign debt markets at the heart of the crises: US, German, Greek, Italian Portuguese and Spanish sovereign debt markets. We ask ourselves are these markets moving according to the Efficient Market Hypothesis or Behavioural Finance Theory?

Title: Studies of African Economies: From Past to Future, Vol.7 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: (Ch.1) This research analyses the effects of structural transformation on sectoral employment and sectoral labour productivity in WAEMU countries. To achieve this, the methodological approach adopted consists of decomposing the economy into three sectors, namely agriculture, industry and services. The results show that the agricultural sector employs 70% of the available labour force as against 10% and 20% respectively for the industrial and service sectors. In terms of value added, the agricultural (rural) sector and the service sector contribute 40% each against 20% for the industrial sector to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for the Sahelian countries. For all WAEMU countries as a whole, the agricultural sector accounts for 30%, industry for 20% and services for 50%. Reallocation effects show that the service sector is the sector benefiting from a better reallocation of the labour factor. This reallocation effect is very pronounced in Burkina Faso compared to all Sahelian countries and all WAEMU countries.(Ch.2) The aim of this chapter is to analyse the determinants of moonlighting in the context of falling worker’s wages in Cameroon. From a sample of Cameroonian workers with a main job a bivariate structural probit model analysis shows that the participation in moonlight jobs is inversely correlated with the level of education and the female gender. But it is positively correlated with both the wage of the main job and age. Moonlighting seems to play a different role in the transition from working life to retirement in Cameroon compared to developed countries.

Title: Global Warming: Carbon emission, global warming and the political economy of energy 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: I came across global warming for the first tite at a visit to late Aaron and Mary Wildavsky in their Oakland home around 1990. When I raised concern about the future and climate change, the Wildavsky couple reacted strongly, telling me that it was just the Mother of all scares. If environmentalism was more political ideology than merely science – the cornucopian thesis – than how could I be so wrong?The second time I encountered global warming was during my stay at Fiji Islands where I taught development. I noticed that environmentalism had to be given a much higher priority in state and society. Environmental policy was far more than the hidden agenda of the Left with the Cornucopians. It offers indeed the only way to save the islands from massive litering.When I settled down in Burma in my wife Mimi’S apartment I began writing small pieces on global warming rather than general environmentalism; as the evidence pointed in one clear direction concerning the former. My first finding was that global warming and energy is practically inseparable, making climate change unstoppable or irreversible  The second finding from reading the global warming debate recognised that a social science perspective simply did not exist. The reason that international cooperation on a Common Pool Regime like the Paris Agreement fails is that global warming presents an Ocean PD game, translating into endless transaction costs.I apologize for several repetitions from one piece to another, reflecting the urgency of speaking out against the cornucopian rejection of global warming. This collection of papers I dedicate to my Burmese companion into the period of climate change.

Title: Currency Boards – Vol.2 Studies on Selected European Countries 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: In 1995, I founded the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise. One of the purposes of that research institute was to continue a research program on currency board systems, which was established in the early 1980s. The program has included the works of many leading experts on currency boards and has benefitted enormously from the involvement of my former post-doctoral student and long-time collaborator Dr. Kurt Schuler.
Many of the papers in this volume focus on various aspects of currency boards. They are original because they are based on primary data. Indeed, the Johns Hopkins research program on currency boards, which is directed by Dr. Schuler and me, has now collected and digitized all of the financial data for virtually all of the currency boards that have ever existed. So, just what is a currency board?An orthodox currency board issues notes and coins convertible on demand into a foreign anchor currency at a fixed rate of exchange. As reserves, it holds low-risk, interest-bearing bonds denominated in the anchor currency and typically some gold. The reserve levels (both floors and ceilings) are set by law and are equal to 100%, or slightly more, of its monetary liabilities (notes, coins, and, if permitted, deposits). A currency board’s convertibility and foreign reserve cover requirements do not extend to deposits at commercial banks or to any other financial assets. A currency board generates profits (seigniorage) from the difference between the interest it earns on its reserve assets and the expense of maintaining its liabilities.

Title: Overview of the Indian Economy 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book brings together papers which highlight various aspects of development of the Indian economy in the recent past. It covers Indian financial markets, movements in the exchange rate, and value creation and innovativeness of the manufacturing sector. In the various chapters, application of analytical tools like R, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Clustering are demonstrated. While two papers dwell on sectoral characteristics and portfolio choice for value creation, two papers focus on understanding stock market volatility and the sources of volatility.For understanding industrial development, economic profit generated by Indian manufacturing companies are calculated over two time periods to see whether there has been any fundamental change in their performance and the sectors within which they belong. The purpose is two-fold. First, to get an idea about how Indian companies have fared over the two time periods and whether there has been any structural change. Second, help companies decide on their next strategic move and allocate funds for the purpose.The reasons for studying stock market volatility are that it i) aids in intraday trading, ii) is the basis of neutral trading in the options market, iii) affects portfolio rebalancing by fund managers, iv) helps in hedging, v) affects capital budgeting decisions through timing of raising equity from the market and its pricing and also vi) affects policy decisions relating to the financial markets. In todays globalized environment, with increased financial integration and also enhanced trade in goods and services, volatility in one country spreads to other countries almost immediately. In India, where foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are large players in the stock market, their fund allocation is shaped by macroeconomic conditions in other economies. Thus any macroeconomic event in any part of the world causes reallocation of FII funds, leading to volatility in Indian stock markets.

Title: Multinational Corporations and Transaction Costs 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book is a study of the multinational corporation from the transaction cost perspective. The firm is a system of administrative relationships based on a nexus of contracts and the strong interdependence of specific assets. The firm substitutes the market mechanism when, in view of resource allocation and the existing transaction costs, it is a more costly instrument than the entrepreneur with his coordinating role. Using the theory advanced by Ronald Coase and Oliver Williamson we investigate some key features of the multinational corporation. We analyze the role of technology for the emergence of multinationals. This emergence is predetermined by scientific discoveries and technological innovations which shorten the geographic distances among economic resources in the world and allow cutting on organizational costs within the firm. The multinational firm is a complex hierarchical structure dispersed in many countries and aimed at replacing the international market in the allocation of global resources. The firm performs this task at less cost than the market. The more costly the different regional or national markets in which multinational firms operate, the greater the advantage of the bureaucracy, the more centralized the company and the lower the autonomy of the subsidiaries.Some further findings are that there are specific risks for multinationals in their operations in the global market since there are various market failures present. Firms overcome those by internal organization, horizontal and vertical integration. Through intrafirm trade and transfer prices companies manage to capture externalities becoming thus a cheaper instrument of resource allocation than the market. The international division of labor transforms into intrafirm division, market pricing turns into transfer prices and the technological transfer turns into intrafirm exchange of technological knowledge and innovations.

Title: Agricultural Economics, Governance and Innovation in Bulgaria Vol.1 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Despite huge progress in the theory and practice of this new area, still there is no consensus on how to assess the sustainability of agro-ecosystems due to diverse understandings, approaches, methods, employed data, etc. In Bulgaria there are practically no deep studies on sustainability level of diverse agro-eco-systems. This paper tries to fill the blank and assesses the sustainability level of agro-ecosystems of different type in Bulgaria. First a holistic hierarchical framework for assessing integral, economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems in Bulgaria is suggested including 17 principles, 35 criteria, and 46 indicators and reference values. After that, an assessment is made on overall and aspects sustainability of large (agro)ecosystems in North-Central, South-Eastern, South-Central and South-Western geographic regions, and particular main and specific types of agro-ecosystems of the country – mountainous, plain-mountainous, plain, riparian (Struma, Maritza, Yantra), southern Black Sea, mountainous area with natural constraints, non-mountainous area with natural constraints, protected areas and reserves, Western Thracian Plain, Middle Danube Plain, Dupnitsa and Sandansko-Petrich Valley, Sredna Gora Mountains and Western Rila Mountains. The assessment is based on first-hand information collected though in-depth interviews with the managers of “typical” farms in the respective ago-ecosystems. The study has found out that there is a considerable differentiation in the level of integral sustainability in agricultural ecosystems of different types. Furthermore, there are substantial variations in the levels of economic, social and ecological sustainability of agro-ecosystems of different type, and the critical indicators enhancing or deterring overall and particular sustainability of individual agro-ecosystems.

Title: COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: One of the current questions in the contemporary scientific debate is to explain factors determining the diffusion of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), a new viral infection that is generating a severe acute respiratory syndrome with serious pneumonia to manifold people worldwide that may result in progressive respiratory failure and death. To reduce the number of total deaths and infected individuals of COVID-19, many countries, universities, public and private research organizations have accelerated the scientific research production generating new knowledge about this new Coronavirus disease, but also many people/organizations not involved in research activities sought to provide innovative solutions, especially adopting what they already know, such as current technologies. This on-going accumulation of knowledge, driven by an accelerated velocity of science production on COVID-19 is due to a process of systematic research in labs to generate effective vaccines, new therapies, and new antiviral drugs that can counteract this global public health threat and future epidemics similar to COVID-19.Current literature in this field of research is rather fragmented and doesn’t tell us in a systematic framework the manifold and complex factors involved in transmission dynamics the COVID-19, effects of public policies (such as, lockdown) on public health and economic system and results for improving decision-making of the crisis management of COVID-19 in society.The goal of this book is to explain some characteristics related to factors determining the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 associated with geography, environment, atmosphere and social structure of cities and regions and effects of public policies applied by governments. In particular, this book, in an interdisciplinary perspective, describes a collection of new researches that can clarify some factors of the spread of COVID-19 in polluted cities extending and effects of containment measures to explain vital relationships that may be helpful for decision making of policymakers in different environments to solve this global health issue or at least reduce its impact in society and future social issues of similar viral agents.
This book is designed for public and private managers and policymakers, as well as general readers that wish to clarify critical aspects of COVID-19 and that wish to expand their knowledge on these areas. I have attempted to minimize the use of extremely complex models, concepts and theories. Studies that I include here are integrated with cases study and empirical analyses based on real contexts of cities and nations, rather than on theoretical models that generate simulations with computer experiments to predict eventual real effects of the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in different urban contexts. In order to attain a reasonable depth, this book concentrates on selected topics of particular relevance to problems of COVID-19, and which meet the needs of the intended audience.

Title: Agricultural Economics, Governance and Innovation in Bulgaria Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: In Bulgaria, like in many other countries, practically there are no comprehensive assessments of the governance sustainability of agriculture and its importance for the overall agrarian development. This study tries to fill the gap and suggests a holistic framework for understanding and assessing the governance sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture. The newly elaborated approach is “tested” in a large-scale study for assessing the governance sustainability of country’s agriculture at national, sectoral, regional, eco-system and farm levels. The study has proved that it is important to include the “missing” Governance Pillar in the assessment of the Integral sustainability of agriculture and sustainability of agro-systems of various type. Multiple Principles, Criteria and Indicators assessment of the Governance sustainability of Bulgarian agriculture indicates that the Overall Governance Sustainability is at a “Good” but very close to the “Satisfactory” level. Besides, there is a considerable differentiation in the level of Integral Governance sustainability of different agro-systems in the country. What is more, the individual indicators with the highest and lowest sustainability values determine the “critical” factors enhancing and deterring the particular and integral Governance sustainability of evaluated agro-system.  Last but not least important, results on the integral agrarian sustainability assessment based on micro (farm) and macro (statistical, etc.) data show some discrepancies which have to be taken into consideration in the analysis and interpretation, while assessment indicators, methods and data sources further improved.The interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is applied and assessment made on specific effects of major components of the “external” institutional environment on agrarian sustainability level in different administrative, geographical and ecological regions, subsectors of agriculture, and farms of variousjuridical type and size in Bulgaria. Our study has found out that individual elements of external institutional, market and natural environment affect quite unequally farms of different types, individual subsectors of agriculture, and specific ecological and geographical regions.This type of studies is to be expended and their precision and representation increased. The latter however, requires a close cooperation between all interested parties, and participation of the farmers, agrarian organizations, local and central authorities, interest groups, research institutes and experts, etc.

Title: Teaching and Evaluation Patterns of a Business BA Program 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Evaluation of BA programs is periodically conducted in the Portuguese public education system, involving inspection of indicators of teaching patterns and student achievement. In its course, primary information is gathered which provides a natural database for a more complex multivariate study of the teaching process. It was the purpose of this research to depart from information collected for the 2000/2001 Self-Evaluation report of the Business BA program of the Faculdade de Ciências Económicas e Empresariais of Universidade Católica Portuguesa and search for identifying patterns of the teaching-mix, and along with it, of student achievement.On the one hand, principal component decomposition provided a general view of the programme main features; discriminant analysis confirmed both scientific area and credit score category as providing significant affiliation identity to the programme courses.On the other, student performance was found significantly related to daily scheduling, teachers profiles and evaluation practices – even if some of the encountered effects may be thought endogenous, but impossible to be controlled for due to the lack of information on student effort.

Title: Pandemic Economy: Covid-19 effects and consequences in the first year 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: A repositioning of the theoretical instruments of development and growth in the context of economics and political economy that we have at our disposal to date seems necessary, especially after the structural transformation caused by the COVID-19 socio-economic and pandemic crisis. Specifically, the overcoming of the COVID-19 era of crisis seems to depend on how we will manage to re-perceive the theory of economic development and apply its proposals in new economic policies, in global terms. In this context, this article examines whether the conceptual and “therapeutic” foundations of development economics have today the necessary potential to cope with structural changes caused by the ongoing global socio-economic crisis. We assess the current debate in the literature of “economic development versus economic growth” and conclude that a new, comprehensive and evolutionary, orientation to understanding economic development seems necessary to respond to new global challenges for the post-COVID-19 era. We propose a multidisciplinary and evolutionary conceptual direction that suggests the multi-angle understanding of diverse historical configurations. We argue that all socio-economic mutations accelerated by the current pandemic crisis have systemic and evolutionary content and effects and cannot be reliably perceived as mere coincidences of “quantities” and growth “performances.” In this way, we can only disagree with any static and linear approach to the current crisis that directly or indirectly leads to reproducing the rigid enclosure of the analysis in partial specializations of economics. On the contrary, we counter-propose a theoretical response of evolutionary type to assess the contemporary theory of economic development and the political economy in the post-COVID-19 era as an interdisciplinary crossroads for all socio-economic sciences.The Covid-19 pandemic raised a few issues concerning how market participants react to a global pandemic. The pandemic was a black swan event on some levels; there had been few pandemics that have had such a global impact: the Spanish Flu of the late 1910s and 1957 influenza. Moreover, global interconnection means that the Covid-19 pandemic was able to spread across the globe quickly, thus indicating that extreme measures were needed to bring it under control. The policies taken by governments around the world had a significant adverse impact on the economy. It is with these factors in mind that we research the psychology of the market participants during the pandemic. Conversely, we introduce a new model of behaviour during uncertainty, which explains how market participants react during crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic. The model analyses the psychological issues, both emotional and cognitive, influencing the pandemic. We found that like any other crises, market participant reacted to government actions and announcements and the impact on the economy. Therefore, leading to the old issue of miscommunication and insufficient actions.

Title: Currency Boards for Developing Countries: A Handbook 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The International Center for Economic Growth, through its offshoot ICS Press, published the original version of this study in 1994. With their permission, we posted a slightly updated version on the Internet in 2000. We thank them again in connection with this edition, which updates a few references to events but is not a comprehensive revision. We are working on a forthcoming, larger book about currency boards with Nicholas Krus that will summarize our quarter-century or more of thinking on the subject.
This book has had a substantial influence. It has been translated into Bulgarian, French, Spanish, Turkish, and Georgian. A modified version, adapted to the specific circumstances of Lithuania, influenced that country’s monetary reform of 1994 (Hanke & Schuler 1994b). Both an unauthorized and an authorized Bulgarian translation were widely read during the high inflation that preceded Bulgaria’s adoption of currency board-like rules in 1997 (Hanke & Schuler 1996, 1997). Most recently, the book has been published in Farsi by the Majlis (Parliament) Research Center of Iran and in Arabic by the Lebanese Institute for Market Studies in Tripoli, Lebanon.

Title: Demand and Institutional Wage Movements 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Chapter 1. The analysis discusses the labor market equilibrium under union oligopoly, where unions represent homogeneous workers and use employment strategies. The following points are addressed: 1. The labor market outcomes in the presence of; a. uncooperative behavior among unions; b. uncooperative environment with a leading union; c. collusive (coordinated unions) behavior among unions; d. globally efficient bargaining, are confronted. A specific example with a Stone-Geary utility function and linear demand is forwarded. 2. Supply dynamics may push up employment and, therefore, the number of unions. In equilibrium, some bounds exist to the number of unions the market can support, which are investigated in the example. Five supply dynamics are considered: a. reservation wage restriction; b. a standard labor supply constraint; c. number of unions equal demand; d. individualistic unions; e. existence of a minimum (employed) membership requirement. The equilibrium number of unions for the Cournot-Nash, Stackelberg and efficient bargaining structures is derived for the case where unions exhibit Stone-Geary preferences and labor demand is linear.Chapter 2. In this chapter we present and confront the expected outcome of a raise in earnings taxes on the regional or sectoral allocation of labor force and employment. The basic frameworks are the benchmark dualistic scenarios. A single-input analysis of an homogeneous product economy is provided once extensions were designed to highlight the role of mobility barriers and how they interact with local wage-setting rules to determine regional allocation rather than trade issues or factor substitution. We report the main effects on equilibrium local after-tax wages, supply, employment and aggregate welfare surplus of a unilateral as well as a simultaneous unit tax increase of the (a) basic two-sector model in six different scenarios: free market; partial (one-sector) coverage with perfect intersector mobility; partial (one-sector) coverage with imperfect mobility (Harris-Todaro); multiple (two-sector) coverage with imperfect mobility (Bhagwati-Hamada); partial (one-sector) coverage with affiliation restrictions in the covered sector; partial (one-sector) coverage with limited employment generation ability in the traditional uncovered sector. Needless to say, the results would apply to any other production factor, one or other scenario being more appropriate for inference of the consequences of differential taxation systems.Chapter 3. This chapter analyzes the labor market outcome when there are two unions in the industry, representing homogeneous workers (hence, unions use employment strategies), in the presence of union employment (quantity) constraints. Three strategic environments are considered: Nash-Cournot duopoly, Stackelberg duopoly and efficient cooperation between the two unions. Employment constraints -ceilings and floors- originate kinks and/or discontinuities in the reaction functions, leading to corner solutions and special features of the labor market equilibrium. Two types of constraints are discussed. One is insufficient employed membership (ceiling) for the interior solution. Then it may be optimal for a Stackelberg leader to push the other to the bound. The other case considered is the legal requirement of a minimum number of employed members that the union must have to be constituted. Entry-deterrence strategies of the leading union may then emerge.

Title: Euro, Brexit and Financial Markets in the European Union 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This chapter (I) We celebrate the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the Euro by reviewing one of the key elements: the integration of the Eurozone financial markets. Introducing a multivariate volatility test based on the asymmetrical BEKK (ABEKK) multivariate GARCH model of volatility to analyse the stable market pre-condition hypothesis of the integrated Eurozone equity markets across the euro’s timeline. Extending our analysis to the impact of the rise of the populist political movement on the Eurozone financial markets during the last few years. The first and most important contribution is the introduction of a multivariate volatility test based on the ABEKK to analyse the stability of the integration in the Eurozone equity markets. However, another key contribution is the analysis of a period where the whole concept of European integration is coming into question by the rise of the populist political movement. This research could be of importance to the ECB in stabilising the Eurozone financial markets as well as market participants in portfolio optimization within the Eurozone. Our results point to a difference in financial market integration depending on the definition. The empirical evidence found that market participants tend to react differently according to the affinity of the market participants to the event/news. In essence, market participants are driven by the “time and space” effect. This would point to evidence that the Eurozone equity markets was never truly integrated in the econometrics sense as defined later on. However, our literature review did identify evidence that the Eurozone equity markets was integrated in accordance with the definition of Baele et al., (2004). Hence it really does depend on the definition used. Generally, our policy recommendations are for a committee to be setup to unify the communication and actions of the European Union during crises. A better way of communicating the work and concept of the European Union to the population. Finally, a slower paced policy of integration to overcome the sense of loss national identity which recently many are plying on.This chapter (II) The recent UK referendum results and subsequent initiation of Article 50 in the 2007 Lisbon Treaty set in motion the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, acknowledge as Brexit. The result and subsequent action were unprecedented and for many unforeseeable. Apart from the political instability and division of the country, the complicated and long process of Brexit have both economic and financial consequences. With this in mind, we analyse the impact of Brexit on four main British financial markets: Equity, Foreign Exchange, Gold and Sovereign Debt; using daily data. We extendthe variance bound test proposed by Fakhry & Richter (2018) underpinned by an asymmetrical C-GARCH-m model of volatility. Unlike many in the past, we placed the emphasis on the stable markets; thus introducing the stable marketpre-condition hypothesis. We analyse the long and short run effects of Brexit on the stability of the UK’s financial market. Our results hint at a certain impact on the UK’s financial market in both the long and short runs on the market stability and hence efficiency. This seems to be dictated by the reaction of market participants to uncertainty surrounding the future of the UK

Title: Critique of Commutopia: On an Economic Concept of the New Left 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Communism, as a revolutionary economic concept, was introduced to the world via the writings of Karl Marx. In practice, it made its big entrance via the Russian Revolution in 1917. The Revolution was instigated and managed by Vladimir Lenin and led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. At its core, communism’s basic idea was to eliminate individual property rights today, while, at the same time, promising the comrades a paradise in the distant future.For the purpose of this preface, allow me to search for the word “communism” on my curriculum vitae to see what shows up.I was born in Vienna in 1944. The Soviet Union appeared almost immediately in my life in the form of tanks in the Russian occupied zone of Austria. When the tanks rumbled up the valley, where I lived near a small town in Upper Austria, my sister and I would run into the woods and hide.  But, that remembrance, while frightening, was minor. A major nightmare concerned my mother. Once, when returning from the American occupied zone, where my mother had gone to obtain medicine, she was accidentally shot by a Russian soldier. She survived, but only after a few weeks of severe crisis. My sister and I learned to say our prayers at that time.
Then, there was Hans Schimmelbusch, my grandfather. He had built a company that supplied machinery for the regulation of the Danube from Vienna to the Black Sea.  He was murdered in cold blood on his front doorstep by Russian soldiers in 1945, when the Soviets confiscated his house in Vienna for use as a “Kommandatura.” My grandfather did not give in. It was not in him.In 1955, I was with my other grandfather, Erich Schlimp, the father of my mother, in a large crowd assembled below the Belvedere castle in Vienna. It was then that the Foreign Ministers of the four occupying powers were assembled on the balcony. They included Minister Vyacheslav Molotov from the Soviet Union. The Austrian Foreign Minister, Leopold Figl, declared from the balcony “Oesterreich ist frei” (Austria is free). The crowd sang the Austrian National Anthem. My grandfather did not sing. He had lost his two sons in the war. He also lost his buildings materials company in Slovakia, which had been nationalized by the communists.

Title: Alternative Sources of Funding for SMEs in Cameroon: A Theoretical Evaluation 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The funding of SMEs is a real problem mainly in poor countries where it is difficult to get financial resources, but also almost impossible to cover an asset intended to be used in the company for years by a resource of the same duration. SMEs like any company seeking to survive and develop explores new ways to achieve secure funding. As banks hardly finance SMEs, they have to resort to alternative funding which is essentially short-term.To inform SMEs of the range of alternative funding methods and to guide them in their choice, we thought it necessary to carry out a theoretical assessment of alternative funding for SMEs.This assessment may be a new start in their fundraising strategies. As victims of the severe rationing of bank credit, SMEs mainly resort to short-term alternative funding: tontines, microfinance institutions, family help, help from friends, inter-company credit, associations, contributions of partners, leasing institutions, capital increases, disposals of fixed assets, venture capital companies and individuals. Meanwhile, SMEs sould fund both long and medium-term needs ans well as hort-term needs. It is therefore necessary to assess alternative funding for SMEs to fully understand the extent to which they can be resorted to cover their needs. This assessment also offers solutions calling on several actors of the economy.

Title: Reviews of Monetary Policy, Currency Boards, and Country Experiences 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: A head of Chapter 1 we feature an exclusive joint interview conducted by Petia Minkova, Deputy Editor in Chief of 168 Hours (a Bulgarian weekly publication) with Prof. Dr. Steve H. Hanke and John Greenwood .Chapter 1 first traces the evolution of Milton Friedman’s views on fiscal policy from his early acceptance of the prevailing Keynesian orthodoxy to his later adoption of an entirely contrary view that fiscal policy played almost no role in macroeconomic stabilization. Until the late 1940s or early 1950s Friedman believed that fiscal policy should be the primary tool of government policy in macroeconomic stabilisation – the management of real GDP growth and inflation. However, by 1953 he had shifted to the diametrically opposite view that fiscal policy played almost no role in macroeconomic stabilisation and that as a result policymakers should rely principally on monetary policy. Second, the chapter explores some of the theoretical arguments Friedman used to defend his new position. Third, the chapter takes up a challenge that Friedman himself proposed to assess the relative importance of monetary and fiscal policies by comparing a series of episodes when fiscal and monetary policies were acting either in the same direction or in opposite directions. All the examples cited confirm Friedman’s finding that monetary policy invariably dominated over fiscal policy in determining macroeconomic outcomes, and particularly when the two policies were acting in contrary directions

Title: Essays in Political Theory Vol.1 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Ch 1. Karl Popper discovered the link between the open society and scientific discovery with the help of his analysis of growth of scientific theories (Popper, 1945, 1959). Only in an open society can hypotheses or models be falsified. His principle of falsification applies not only to scientific argument but also to social science beliefs and political propaganda. Thus, democracy nourishes an open society seeking the truth. Actually, democracy is the sole political regime that promotes the truth in an open society. The rationale for democracy is to be found in game theory, in particular the principal agent framework in the economics of information.Ch 2. What is true information in today’s world? The hunt for information is not only in the private sector―market trends and enterprise data, but also on the public sector. Information is strongly linked with incentives; leaking news and you have an extra rent. This paper tries to model the crucial role of information and its incentives in government and it started in the public sector.Ch3. The World Bank now launches the concept of developmental governance as commitment, coordination and cooperation. When unpacked, development governance is no clearer than the concept of development administration. It is true that countries need development to improve living conditions for their citizens, but development includes more than governance or good governance.

Title: Essays in Economics: Macroeconomic analyzes and perspectives of economic thought 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: hapter 1: The purpose of this chapter is to provide insights into how the proliferation of globalization has impacted labor markets both in a advanced industrialized nations and well as developing nations. Insightful analysis will be drawn from Oatley (2011) on division of labor, Jaumotte & Tytell (2007) on labor compensation, Hahn & Narjoko (2013) on the impact on South Asian Countries, Basu (2016) on wage as a share of GDP and Wallace, Gauchat & Fullerton (2011) on the impact of globalization and labor markets on inequality.Chapter 2: Building on the system of reason provided for by the Greek philosopher and specifically Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas built a comprehensive system and theory of natural law which has lasted through the ages. The theory was further developed in the Middle Ages and in the Enlightenment Ages by many a prominent philosopher and economist and has been recognized in the Modern Age. The natural law-theory and system has been repeatedly applied to the spheres of economic thought and has produced many lasting contributions such as private property rights and individual rights. In recent times with the collapses of the financial system and rapid globalization, there has been a renewed interest in the application of natural law theory to economics to counter a certain anthropology and distortion of values created by a modern economic system of self-preservation deriving its insights from the philosophies of Thomas Hobbes and Niccolo Machiavelli.Chapter 3: The credit crises experienced in the US in year 2008 is labeled as perhaps the most significant crises since the great depression. The roots of the crises were found in the default of the sub-prime mortgages and the failure occurred in both the US and the UK. Due to the integrated nature of international financial systems the spillover impacted many countries as the economies in Asia and Europe were purchasers of the sub-prime mortgages that originated in both UK and US. The impact of the credit crises in Canada is of unique importance due to the close proximity to US, and both the US and Canada being of great strategic importance to each other as well as one of the largest trading partners.Even though the international financial credit crises adversely impacted many countries, the evidence that has come across recent years point towards the conclusion that Canada was able to weather the crises much better than many other countries.

Title: Political Economy Inquiries Vol.1 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: It is possible to present a brief summary of the subjects that the chapters in this book focus on.
Ch 1. The principal-agent models may be employed to elucidate central problems in interaction between prin-cipals and agents in both policy implementation and public policy-making concerning performance and remuneration. One then hits upon the double principal-agent relationships that are typical of the policy cycle, from policy-making to policy implementation and back: 1) government as principal for agents in public service delivery; 2) the population as principal for political agents under various forms of rulership.
Ch 2. Today there is a set of well-ordered countries to which many people would liķe to move. What is their advantage? Reply: they are well-ordered im the public and private sectors adhering to the Keynesian model of a mixed economy.Ch 3. The Republic of Fiji Islands has been under military rule since December 2006. Yet, the regime of Frank Bainimarama is not really like any other military regime in the world, nor does the 2006 coup resemble the earlier military interventions in the country. It is attempting development without freedom, but can it succeed? It is important to recognize that dictatorships can be of very different kinds. What happens with the Bainimarama regime will have a major impact upon the Pacific scene, not only for the Fiji Islands but also for the Pacific Forum and the role of China in regional integration. And the course of future events will depend much upon what strategy Fiji´s strongman chooses and what kind of constitution is put in place.

Title: Economic Policy and Transition Economies 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Chapter 1. This section is examined statistically whether the importance of the motives for act and the acceptances for lower wage and labor incentives is different between each age group. Above results shows young age group is “self-actualization” as important motive, old age group is “moral” as it. And old age group has higher labor incentives when it is suggested higher wage than the wage according to my ability, and when it is the lifetime employment system. Older age group think “moral” as important motive. They think that want to rewarded with the lifetime employment system and higher wage. It checked that action motives differed according to a generation. Moreover, Prospect Theory, the efficiency wage hypothesis, and the relative wage hypothesis were satisfied, and it was checked that the influences differ in his twenties as compared with other generations. Moreover, the rate of desiring lifelong employment system as a senior was large, and his twenties had many people who do not desire lifelong employment system strongly. This shows that consciousness change and a behavioral change may have arisen in that time in 1990 which shifted to the market economy bordering on people who were his teens, i.e., his present twenties, and his 30’s. It is shown that there is no big difference the results of transition country, the results of advanced nations, especially the result of Japan.
Chapter 2. In this section, the money illusion not only has arisen, but it was checked that a time preference rate is not constant. If it is consumed as the younger age group and a rate of time preference changes with generations, it will be thought that 1-dollar value changes with generations. That is, even if the loss of the same amount produces the younger age group and an old age layer, if it is the younger age group, a loss may also feel the loss by a money illusion small. That is, the time preference rate which affects consumption smoothing also affects a money illusion. The difference for every generation of a time preference rate becomes larger than the influence which only consumption smoothing has on people’s economical action. It has a possibility of bringing a big difference to the economical action for every generation. If the preference of a between at the different time changes with generations, the consumer behaviors at a certain time not only differ for every generation, but it will be thought that the reactions to a loss also differ.

Abstract: Ch 21. The beginnings of this century sets up the dilemma of more energy or betterment of the environment. If “energy” is the capacity to do work, as often said, then it can be made profitable. If protecting the ecology of Earth is what the COP reunions of the UN aim at, then it is hardly a surprise that China and India reneged against the original formulation of phasing out coal power. Both countries use a lot of coal plants to get cheap energy for rapid economic development. This is dismal fact for COP endeavours.
Ch 22. One may approach the history of political thought through a variety of themes that various philosophers share but handle very differently. I wish here to capture a few trends in political thought by analysis of the following two long lived themes, namely: naturalism against moralism as well as determinism versus voluntarism.

Title: About the Governance of Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System in Bulgaria 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Unlike in many other countries, in Bulgaria, there is no comprehensive analysis of the governance, state, efficiency and evolution of the system of Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation System (AKIS). This chapter presents the results of a large-scale study on the governance, efficiency, and development of AKIS in Bulgaria. The Governance of AKIS includes diverse governing agents, and the variety of rules, mechanisms and modes for agents, and the process of governing, and the outcome (specific order and efficiency) of the governance.First, participants in the country’s AKIS and the type of their relations are specified. Second, a diagnosis of the state and trends in AR&D is made. Third, the governance of agrarian research in Bulgaria is unpacked. Forth, the state of the system of education and training of agricultural producers in the country is analyzed. Fifth, the governance of the system of advice and consultations in agriculture is assessed. Six, results of an expert assessment on the governance of AKIS in Bulgaria are presented. Finally, the results of SWOT analysis and presented, and development strategy and intervention needs for AKIS for the next programming period are specified.Modern scientific approaches of Comparative Data and Institutional Analysis, Gap Analysis, SWOT, Strategic Orientation, Experts Assessments, etc. are used to identify actors and relations, state and trends in development, assess Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, formulate adequate strategy, and specify overall and public intervention needs of AKIS in the country. The study is based on available data from statistical sources, official reports, fields surveys as well as assessments of a panel of leading experts in the area and stakeholders’ representatives.

Title: Monetary Policy and Currency Boards Asia Pacific Countries Examples Vol.1 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: It is possible to present a brief summary of the subjects that the chapters in this book focus on.
Ch 1. This essay examines the Malayan Currency Board from its formation in 1938 to its dissolution in 1967. It analyzes the orthodoxy of the board using high-frequency data, such as monthly statistics of currency notes in circulation. Accompanying the essay is a spreadsheet workbook which presents high-frequency data of the board in digital format for the first time, as well as balance sheets and other financial statements.Ch 2. Sri Lanka had a currency board system from 1884 to 1950 which maintained a relative stability in prices and the exchange rate. However, the currency board was replaced by a central bank in 1950 with the objective of providing a more dynamic service to the newly independent economy. With the failure of the central bank in maintaining the stability of the value of the rupee domestically as well as externally, a growing demand has arisen for the return to a currency board system in the country. This essay, intended to educate the general public of the implications involved, covers the origin of the currency board system in Sri Lanka, its performance during the colonial period, why independent Sri Lanka chose to establish a central bank, while Singapore decided to continue with a Currency Board, the case for Currency Boards as presented by its modern-day crusader Steve Hanke, and how the failure of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank will pave way for the establishment of a currency board in Sri Lanka.Ch 3. We provide a spreadsheet data series and legislative history of the Burma Currency Board (BCB) from 1948 to 1952. The chaper assesses the level of orthodoxy exhibited by the board through analysis of legislation and statistics from quarterly bulletins. We also do a comparative analysis of economic health during and after the currency board era through use of economic markers. This paper makes various balance sheet data available in machine-readable form in a companion spreadsheet workbook.

Title: he Entrepreneurial Multiplier Effect 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Since the Keynesian revolution in economics, a standard part of the profession’s analytical framework and an argument for government support for investment has been the multiplier concept. This classical multiplier works through consumption in an equilibrium model. Our contention is that there is also an Entrepreneurial Multiplier that works directly through investment by incentivizing or forcing investments in innovation in a dynamic, disequilibrium model. These investments have been analyzed as “spill-overs” or responses to “bottlenecks” or Schumpeterian examples of emulation. We suggest that the surges of innovation in capitalism were even broader than Schumpeter did and that they can best be explored using a multiplier paradigm. We start that exploration by briefly examining selected patterns of entrepreneurship in the first, second, and third industrial revolutions. Our emphasis is on the sequences of innovations, the manner in which they are multiplied, and their economic, cultural and political consequences. We delve into the First Industrial Revolution in New England and Lombardy, the Second Industrial Revolution in the United States and France, and the Third Industrial Revolution in America and Europe. In all three of these dramatic capitalist transitions there is evidence of the entrepreneurial multiplier at work, broadening, deepening, and extending the impact of the major innovations.

Title: Can UK Banks Pass the COVID-19 Stress Test? 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: As the UK economy enters the COVID-19 downturn, the Bank of England (BoE) continues to maintain that the UK banks are strongly capitalised. Yet there is considerable evidence that they are anything but.The core metrics of the Big Five UK banks have deteriorated sharply since the New Year, and even more since the end of 2006, i.e., the eve of the Global Financial Crisis. Their market capitalisation is now £140.6 billion, down 61% since December 2006; their average price-to-book ratio is 39.2%, down from 255% at end 2006; their average capital ratio, defined as market capitalisation divided by total assets, is 2.3%, down from 11.2% at the end of 2006; their corresponding leverage levels are 43.3, up from 8.9 (end 2006). By these metrics, UK banks have much lower capital ratios and their leverage is nearly 5 times what it was going into the previous crisis.These metrics indicate a sickly banking system. If the banks were in good financial shape, their PtB ratios would be well above 100% and their capital ratios well above current levels. Traditional rules of thumb also suggest that leverage levels should be no greater than 10 or 15 to be considered safe.In addition, UK banks have hidden problems relating to their off-balance-sheet positions, their gameable ‘Fair Value’ Level 3 (or ‘mark to model’) and loan book valuations, and their problematic implementation of IFRS 9, all of which have further adverse consequences for their capital adequacy.The BoE’s ‘Great Capital Rebuild’ narrative about a strongly recapitalised UK banking system is little more than an elaborate, and occasionally shambolic, window dressing exercise. The BoE focused most of its efforts on making the banking system appear strong by boosting banks’ regulatory capital ratios instead of ensuring that the banking system became strong through a sufficiently large increase in actual capital meaningfully measured. The result is that the UK banking system enters the downturn in a worryingly fragile state and avoidably so.

Title: Global Warming Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Ch 1. Global warming is the result of an enormous drive for energy during the last 150 years. And demand keeps going up making the COP goals unachievable. I will argue for this inevitability by means of both global and local evidence.
Ch 2. Global warming is the result of an enormous drive for energy during the last 150 years. And demand keeps going up making the COP goals unachievable. Fossils will still dominate with renewables as only increments. Author supports this inevitability argument with data about global trends and local analysis of a few of the heavy emitters of CO2s. Since the demand for energy is still rising, one understands why China and India as well as Brazil and Indonesia renege on the COP ambitions. In fact, all states in the COP club renege somehow, because the demand for energy is overwhelming. Despite this several countries face today energy shortage.
Ch 3. Human beings have existed as modern homo sapiens for some 100 000 years, recent DNA research informs. And this race has grown to a staggering 8 billion almost, dominant over all other living species and subjugating the other human races. The 21th century will end the fantastic story about Cro-Magnons as planet Earth no longer will support advanced forms of life, I.e. low temperature, supply of food, access to drinking water as well as war between or within nations and even civilisations. Only intergovernmental coordination can slow the process of climate change, but the nature of international relations prohibits it.

Title: Studies of African Economies: From Past to Future, Vol.8 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: hapter 1: For decades crisis has been considered a major obstacle to socio-economic development of many African countries south of the Sahara. It is challenging because it affects all economic sectors and the population. The paper analyses the challenges of the causes of Anglophone crisis, and its consequences in Cameroon in general. Asystematic random sampling technique of one hundred and fifty (150) households, that is seventy five (75) town dwellers households and seventy five (75) food crops productionhouseholdsin the city of Kumba and Bamenda and its environ was adopted. The issues raised by the respondents were statistically analyzed by the use of Statistical Package for Student Survey, maps were produced by the cartographic software Arcgis, excel was use to realize figures and tables. Results from the findings are presented as follows; It was revealed that the Foumban Conference and decision taken by the former and present presidents constitute a major problem that will always escalate to conflict if federation is not implemented as accepted in the Foumban Conference. The finding also show that the city of Kumba past glories and that of tired Cameroon have been damaged by the Anglophone crisis that escalated in 2016. Wanton destruction of farmlands, energetic youthful population that represents over 60% of labour force in agricultural sector killed, while others flight away to nearby areas modifying their demographic structure. These factors have pushed the population to develop four strategies to cope with economic insecurity in the area: the creations of garden and poultry farms besides residence, creation of spontaneous markets, temporal migration and the establishment of instant lists of vulnerable population.Chapter 2: The burden of kidney failure remains largely underreported in East Africa. Health systems face numerous challenges including a lack of kidney registries, shortages of trained skilled healthcare workers, a lack of diagnostic support, a lack of equipment, and underdeveloped policies to govern the provision of treatment for kidney failure. Kidney transplantation, an effective treatment option against kidney failure, is underused primarily because of its cost and the lack of laws governing it. In this paper, the author discusses the salient issues affecting kidney donation and transplantation in East Africa.

Title: Essays in Political Theory Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: It is possible to present a brief summary of the subjects that the chapters in this book focus on.
Ch 11. In  political thought, Hobbes and Spinoza form an interesting and fascinating couple. They lived parallel lives and wrote much on similar topics: humans, contracts, the state and religion. Whereas Hobbes is considered one of the absolute top political philosophers, Spinoza has only been recognized as a great philosopher, due to his Ethics. But on close examination, I dare say that Spinoza outperforms Hobbes also on political theory and religion. The aim of this paper is to call for a re-evaluation of Spinoza’s political and religious philosophy.Ch 12. Spinoza has a formidable reputation as an abstract philosopher in the rationalist school of the 17th century. This standard image of him stems from his elegant Ethics, examining men and women with the Euclidean method of axioms, corollaries and implications. He launched a fascinating theory about moral naturalism and ethical determinism, much debated by other great philosophers. However, he also has two political texts, one on religion and another on political regime. They are much more reader friendly and the arguments are simple, following from the foundations in Ethics. At least, Spinoza so believed. This paper presents systematically the political theory in Tractatus Politicus, which has received too little attention.

Title: The Chaos that was Enron 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract:  The collapse of Enron in 2001 was due not as much to perfidy as it was to a deeply flawed business plan. Enron and its predecessors had participated in, and to some extent drove, the restructuring of the natural gas industry. For years, natural gas production, transportation and consumption had been a stable, highly regulated business. That stability collapsed in the 1970s and a new commodity-based industry emerged. In that process Enron grew rapidly and was very profitable. The deregulation of natural gas prices had a similar impact on the industry as major technological innovations had on other industries. Early movers made a lot of money, but eventually the opportunities diminished as new entrants drove down margins and stability returned. By the final deregulation of gas prices in 1993, the opportunities for entrepreneurial returns had essentially vanished.The meteoric rise of the Enron Corporation and its equally rapid flameout is often portrayed in terms of the personalities involved. The personal histories of Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow are recounted to explain the path Enron took. Hubris, greed, and poor management practices are often seen as the source of the company’s failure. Undoubtedly those were present, but most executives have, at least to some extent, the same flaws. And, one might add, at the time business commentators marveled at the acumen of the Enron management who had evidently discovered new ways to make money. Pictures of Enron’s leaders often appeared on the covers of business publications with stories inside lauding their management techniques. Few Wall Street analysts found fault with the Enron game plan.

Title: Opinions: Business History and Anthropology 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book is dedicated to one of its co-authors, Professor Gwendolyn Gordon, who died at the much too early age of forty-one in December 2021.
Gwen Gordon was appointed as a member of the standing faculty in the Legal Studies & Business Ethics Department of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 2013.  Professor Gordon was a graduate of Cornell University and Harvard Law School, and she received her doctorate in anthropology from Princeton University.  Prior to joining Wharton, she worked as a corporate lawyer with Shearman & Sterling in New York and London.
Professor Gordon’s research interests were wide-ranging.  Her ethnographic research focused on the cultural norms and contemporary practices of corporate governance and social responsibility. She did long-term fieldwork studying an indigenously owned corporation in New Zealand.As indicated in her contribution with me here (and she was the lead partner in the writing of it), Gwen believed deeply in the importance of the anthropological study of business, particularly as informed by legal and historical understandings.  Gwen also had a keen interest in environmental protection and advanced the important idea of “environmental personhood” in an article in the Columbia Journal of Environmental Law (2019).A gifted writer of fiction as well as nonfiction, she is dearly missed by her many friends, family, and colleagues.

Title: Political Economy Inquiries Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: It is possible to present a brief summary of the subjects that the chapters in this book focus on.Ch 1. The outcome of the COP27 confirms the PD game nature of the work of this UN club, CUT defeated by EMIT (emissions). The same will hold for forward COPs, until such time that the tipping points change the game for the great players in this global environment club.Ch 2. The analytical-synthetic distinction keeps being of great interest. But why? Analytical sentences are camouflaged tautologies. They are not falsifiable, neither in this Kant’s world or in any of Leibniz’ possible worlds.Ch 3. Communitarianism offers a rationale for the growing relevance of communities. Its key question is also the one that globalisation makes highly relevant, namely: Who are we? What way of life do we wish to support? Communitarianism underlines the politics of mutual respect as the democratic state’s proper reaction to multiculturalism. Such a politics of mutual respect would be truly global. The paradox of globalisation is that it both makes communal politics more salient while it at the same time calls for a politics of mutual respect which may reduce ethnic and religious conflict. Globalisation increases the search for communal identity. However, a politics of mutual respect may reduce conflicts between communities and enhance global respect for different cultures, where different civilisations accept a common core of institutions.Ch 4. The theory of chaos has hitherto been pursued in the natural sciences. However, it may illuminate some issues in the social sciences too.

Title: The Eumaeus Guide to Equity Release Valuation 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The UK equity release sector is permeated by poor valuation practice: as far as we are aware, not a single equity release firm is valuing its No-Negative Equity Guarantees (NNEGs) in a scientifically valid manner.This NNEG under-valuation problem is on a large scale and implies correspondingly large over-valuations of Equity Release Mortgages (ERMs).The Discounted Projection or ‘Real World’ approach used by the equity release industry is inherently flawed and produces valuations that violate bounds that are known to be inviolable.The only scientifically valid valuation approach is the Market Consistent approach, which is also the only approach compatible with accounting principles and technical actuarial standards.This manual provides a guide that explains how NNEGs and ERM should (and should not) be valued.

Title: Monetary Policy and Currency Boards Latin America and Caribbean Countries Examples Vol.1 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: It is possible to present a brief summary of the subjects that the chapters in this book focus on.Ch 1. Mr. Chairman, thank you for this opportunity to express my views on “Venezuela’s Tragic Meltdown.” A great deal of the commentary on the topic is polemical, and more-or-less political and ideological self-justifications of one sort or another. In consequence, the discourse is often confused and confusing. In an attempt to bring some clarity to the topic, I will focus on the one necessary condition that must be satisfied before the Venezuelan economy can be turned around. Inflation must be stopped before stability can be established. Stability might not be everything, but everything is nothing without stability.Ch 2. This chapter describes the methodology and presents the results of a Datincorp survey on Venezuela’s economic crisis. The survey was carried out in March 2017. A majority of Venezuelans do not trust the Central Bank of Venezuela, and believe that immediate change is necessary. A majority of Venezuelans also indicate that the implementation of dollarization or an orthodox currency board are not only the most desirable solutions in theory, but are also highly supported by Venezuelan public opinion.
Ch 3. For many reasons, dollarization is an efficient and realistic option for this country. Yet, in order to last, it must be able to withstand banking panics without the assistance of a conventional lender of last resort and the lobby of protected industries to revoke dollarization. To this end, we advance a model of commercial banking close to that of Panama, under foreign law, and argue for free trade agreements with superpowers to smooth out real-exchange rate fluctuations.

Title: Uncommon Arguments on Common Topics: Essays on Political Economy and Diplomacy 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: I wrote decades ago on the causes of the Great Depression, emphasizing the roles of both the post-WW1 undervaluation of gold and the deflationary policies of the Federal Reserve and, even more, of the Bank of France.  Since publication of Gold, France, and the Great Depression (1997), we have seen the Asian crisis of the late 1990s, the Great Recession of 2007-2009, a subsequent decade of slow growth, and the pandemic and subsequent inflation of 2020-2022.  Contents here include comments on each of these. I also became interested in theoretical issues involving monetary and fiscal policy, especially as they appear in J.M. Keynes and in Robert Mundell. Elsewhere, it has loomed for me as an unfinished task to understand better why Cold War events, including Berlin and Vietnam, unfolded as they did. I include two papers here that are clarifying, including of the roles of US and international leaders. Finally, I spent years working on economic development and political reconstruction in the Middle East and central Asia, and include observations on what happened there and what should have been done differently.

Title: Fiscal Independence from Electoral Accountability 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract:  This study is based on an intuitive idea: National governors tend toward rapacity if not checked. In order not to be dominated and despoiled, the people—or the electorate—must have some way of making governors accountable for their spending. Honest elections are the most basic means of exerting such accountability, but they are not the only way. When governors are not fiscally accountable, we say they are “fiscally independent.”Inspired by historical divergent political-economic paths in England, France, Portugal, and Spain, we examine the modern conditionally estimated effects of government being fiscally independent. This study documents that higher levels of fiscal independence are associated with detrimental effects on the quality of democracy, the rule of law, judicial independence, freedom of speech, clean elections, and other desirable outcomes. Fiscal independence is detrimental to human well-being. Fiscal independence is also associated with greater state ownership of productive assets and dictatorship.Our proxy for fiscal independence is a novel and sturdy conditional determinant of political development. Finally, years of education are also conditionally determined by fiscal independence.

Title: COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still circulating in 2022 with new variants (e.g., Delta and Omicron) that generate socioeconomic issues in countries. This contribution endeavors to clarify the origin of novel coronaviruses, factors determining the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and the effects of non-pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical interventions of containment in society. These basic aspects of COVID-19 pandemic crisis can improve the preparedness of countries to cope with next pandemic threats and the negative effects of their socio-economic impact.This book is designed for policymakers and general readers that wish to clarify critical aspects of COVID-19 and that wish to expand their knowledge on these areas. Studies that I include here are integrated with cases study and empirical analyses underpinned in real contexts of nations. In particular, this book concentrates on selected topics of particular relevance to problems of COVID-19 pandemic crisis, and which meet the needs of the intended audience.

Title: Monetary Policy and Currency Boards: Asia Pacific Countries Examples, Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Ch 1. We examine to what extent India’s Paper Currency Department (1862-1935) operated like a currency board, using statistical tests based on its monthly balance sheet. Our paper makes the monthly balance sheet data available in machine-readable form for the first time, in a companion spreadsheet workbook, and likewise for the first time offers a through summary of legislation related to the Paper Currency Department.
Ch 2. China’s economy has slowed down in the last several years, with annual GDP growth falling from 10.6 percent in 2010 to 6.7 percent in 2016. In February 2016 Zhou Xiaochuan, the governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), announced a new goal of having a “stabilizing yet flexible” exchange rate to replace the previous policy of de facto gradual appreciation against the U.S. dollar. Observers have since become more uncertain of the PBOC’s next step. Economists have argued for years about the exchange rate system China should adopt—a currency board with a fixed exchange rate, a pegged system such as China had before 2005, or a flexible exchange rate, which could range from managed floating to free floating. What do contemporary economists think about the issue of the exchange rate system? What do they think should be the PBOC’s next move? What opinions do they voice about the new role of China’s currency as a component of the International Monetary Fund’s Special Drawing Right? I collect and analyze the views of several leading economists on the benefits and costs for China of various exchange rate policies.

Title: Single-Name Credit Default Swaps  
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: Single-name credit default swaps (“CDSs”) are derivatives based on the credit risk of a single borrower such as a corporation or sovereign. Although the single-name CDS market expanded rapidly during the period of loose monetary policy and expanding credit from 2002 through 2007, its growth began to slow after the global credit crisis and during the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis in 2010 and 2011, after which the single-name CDS market began to contract. In recent years and despite deliberate efforts by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) and market participants on both the buy and sell sides, the single-name CDS market shifted from stagnating growth to an actual contraction and has shrunk substantially. At its high-water mark in June 2011, the total notional amount outstanding on single-name CDSs based on corporate and sovereign borrowers was $15.4 trillion. By June 2015, notional outstanding had collapsed to $6 trillion – i.e., a contraction of 61 percent over four years.Several possible reasons may explain the recent decline in single-name CDS activity. One possibility is that the current environment of relatively low interest rates and default rates has reduced the demand for hedging and synthetic bond investments (a.k.a. taking a position on the credit risk of a borrower) using CDSs. Another oft-cited potential explanation for the post- 2011 contraction in the single-name CDS market is the panoply of changes to the global financial regulatory framework, such as margin and capital requirements on cleared and non- cleared swaps and the ban in the E.U. on short selling using sovereign CDSs. Such regulatory changes have already reportedly raised costs and decreased demand for single-name CDSs (or for hedging entity-specific credit risk altogether) even though many regulatory initiatives have still not been implemented in final form.

Title: Investment, and Behavioral Finance 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book has complied with three Journals papers and three working papers, a total of six papers. For all the journal papers, we have obtained permission from the Editors/Editors-in-Chief to include all the journal papers in our book and we have all the rights for our working papers. Thus, we do not have any copyright issue in our book. This book includes the part I: Savings: Chapter 1 would provide a positive contribution to the literature on saving behavior for Chinese communities; the part II Investment: Chapter 2 shows that investors are interested to know how long the bull run will last. While the Singapore markets may not be as efficient as that of the US. Chapters 3 and 4 are helpful for portfolio managers and investors to engage in real-life hedging practices and may also be useful for them to understand the volatility and return spillover effects between gold and different stock sectors in Hong Kong. Also, it is found that there is one cointegration relationship among the nine national stock markets under study (India, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Pakistan); the part III Behavioural Finance: Chapter 5 suggests that small investors have some disposition effect, mental accounts, anchors in mind, with the empirical results basically consistent with the predictions of behavioural finance theory in the Hong Kong derivatives markets; part IV Commentaries: Chapter 6 identifies some major exogenous factors that determining the extent of the discrepancy between the total value of monetary transactions and GDP in China. Four of the authors spend one year to complete this book ‘Savings, Investment, and Behavioural Finance’. We are eager to get this book published and intend to keep in friendship.

Title: A Review of the Academic Literature on the Causes and Evolution of the Credit Crisis 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: A huge literature has emerged analyzing the causes and evolution of the credit crisis that began in 2007. Several literature surveys have also been written on the causes of the crisis, but most such surveys have discussed the crisis literature in the abstract. This paper provides a current review of the causes of the credit crisis and the timing and evolution of the crisis, thereby putting the various causes and proposed explanations into proper context. The vast majority of the literature supports the notions that the fundamental causes of the crisis were loose monetary policies, significant imbalances across global current accounts, underpriced credit and liquidity risk in certain structured products (as well as some other fixed-income products), disclosed and known declines in mortgage underwriting standards, and the downturn in house price appreciation (and eventually the downturn in housing prices). Although significant attention has been paid to fraud and undisclosed declines in mortgage underwriting standards, the empirical support for the idea that these declines in and of themselves were a significant cause of the credit crisis is limited (albeit not non-existent).

Title: Monetary Policy and Currency Boards Latin America and Caribbean Countries Examples Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: It is possible to present a brief summary of the subjects that the chapters in this book focus on.Ch 1. The Hanke-Krus World Hyperinflation Table first appeared in the authoritative Routledge Handbook of Major Events in Economic History, which was published in 2013. The table contained every country that had ever experienced a hyperinflation – all 56 of them. With this paper, we amend the Table and add a 57th entry: Venezuela. On December 3, 2016, Venezuela’s inflation met all the criteria required to qualify as a hyperinflation. Specifically, Venezuela’s monthly inflation rate exceeded 50 percent per month for 30 consecutive days.Ch 2. This chapter examines Argentina’s Caja de Conversión in 1907 and 1908, when a financial panic affected a number of other financial markets. Through an analysis of the Caja’s monthly balance sheets (digitized in an accompanying workbook), it tests the degree of the Caja’s currency board orthodoxy and analyzes the effects of the panic on the Argentine economy.Ch 3. We examine to what extent Bermuda’s monetary authorities have operated like currency boards, using statistical tests based on balance sheets and an analysis of Bermuda’s legislation. Our analysis indicates that in the early 20th century, Bermuda had a currency board system. In later years, problems with analyzing the balance sheet make a judgment based on statistical tests more difficult. We provide a companion spreadsheet workbook of annual or semiannual data of the monetary authority for the past 100 years.

Title: Independence versus Unlimited Power: Has the European Central Bank become a source of financial instability? 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: In the following account, I shall outline a  sceptical view of the ECB’s policy and its institutional role. By pursuing profligate policies and exerting increasingly substantial supervisory powers, the ECB has significantly contributed to the potential instability of the financial system and to the degradation of its reputation in certain countries like the Netherlands and Germany.  To fuel this thesis, the balance of the ECB measures since 2010 will be examined.Moreover, the ECB is confronted with a growing academic controversy regarding its policy which have not achieved the desired effect. As the most indebted member states of the Eurozone want the ECB’s policy of zero interest rates and capital market distortions by QE to be pursued, the ECB categorically ignores all attempts at critical academic dialogue and refuses for the time being to elaborate on an exit strategy. On the contrary on July 25th 2019   the ECB announced the tasking of all relevant ECB working groups to create proposals for a new chapter of unconventional policy. On September 12th 2019 the ECB even took the decision to decrease the deposit floor rate further and to restart net purchase of public bonds at a monthly rate of 20 billion Euros. Meanwhile, the ECB has received unsolicited proposals to revolutionize monetary policy by putting investment facilities at the disposal of national budgets, in addition to the eye-catching measure of making ECB credits directly available to consumers.

Title: Critical Essays on Politics Vol.1 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: It is possible to present a brief summary of the subjects that the chapters in this book focus on.Ch 1. The 21st century will most probably be the last one for mankind. First, the threat of nuclear confrontation is imminently present in the Ukraine war, where with escalation, it becomes global. Second, global warming will make life unbearable. There is no strategically viable way out of the heating up of the planet, as every state cheats. Now, we have 425 ppm.Ch 2. Professor M. Sandel argues in the book Justice: What is the Right Thing to do, that virtue and the common good capture the essence of morality as well as that justice is dependent upon morality. These two arguments come from his well-known lectures with Harvard University. But can they be upheld? Or are these words -“virtue” and “common good”- building stones of morality?Ch 3. Global attention is now very much directed onto questions of war and military armaments. In a long run perspective on humankind in the 21st century, global warming raises an even more fundamental problem of human survival. By heating the planet through greenhouse gases, especially CO2 and methane, rich countries risk their affluence and poor countries will be even worse.

Title: The Competence of the National Congress in Brazil to Decide on Policy Domains Marked by a High Degree of Technical Complexity 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book delves into the intricate relationship between legislative power, and public policy efficiency, exploring their impact on the formulation and implementation of public policies in Brazil. The book adopts a mixed-method approach, combining descriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis, to shed light on this less-explored aspect of legislative functioning, investigating whether the Legislative Power in Brazil uses its competence to vote on matters of a specialized nature or delegates the rule to the Executive Power. The legislative process analyzed in this thesis is one of a Provisional Measure. This process is the most appropriate because it involves both houses of Congress and begins with the Executive branch enacting the rule. Descriptive statistics show correlations between key variables, while qualitative content analysis revealed a preference for the Legislative Power to regulate matters of technical nature rather than delegating them to specialized bodies. The book's findings underscore the importance of public trust in government actions, as both the Executive and Legislative branches need to prioritize transparency, accountability, and responsiveness to maintain public confidence in the regulatory process. Policymakers must carefully assess the context and objectives of each regulatory proposal to make informed decisions about delegation that best serve the public's interests and the government's effective functioning.

Title: Essays in Social Theory 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: The mind-body problem receives new attention, partly under the inspiration from the success of quantum mechanics. Here I will discuss reductionism. The mind-body problem remains central to modern philosophy, no doubt stimulated by the progress in brain research. Following Thomas Nagel’s article on bats, one may similarly examine one of history’s champions. I will also deny reduction or physicalism, though my argument is very much simpler than Chalmers (1996).
One may argue that modern social theory must be relevant for political science. But modern social theory has a strong inclination towards subjectivism: is this relevant for political theory? I do not think so, because subjectivism is in reality a philosophical position, consisting of a theory of epistemology for the social sciences which is not only wrong but borders on nonsense. Modern subjectivism, or as it is somewhat ludicrously called: `post-modernism', is basically the ambition to crush what is called `objectivism', by launching a special version of 'subjectivism', i.e. a theory regarding what social science knowledge is all about. Thus, subjectivism is an argument for a new epistemology for any kind of social theory, includi4 political science, replacing the major objectivist arguments of the 20th century.

Title: Asleep at the Wheel: The Prudential Regulation Authority and the Equity Release Sector 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: There is a scandal brewing in the Equity Release Mortgage sector. This scandal is similar in nature to the Equitable Life scandal of nearly two decades ago – it involves the under-estimation of opaque long-term guarantees – but on a larger scale.The guarantees at the heart of this problem are the No-Negative Equity Guarantees issued by lenders in the Equity Release market. These guarantee that the maximum repayment on Equity Release Mortgage loans can be no greater than the property price at the time of repayment.This under-valuation problem is a ticking time bomb that could do serious damage to the financial health of the Equity Release sector.The regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, has made half-hearted efforts to address this under-valuation problem, but has failed to rein in firms that continue to use inadequate valuation methods for their No Negative Equity Guarantees.A recent Treasury Committee investigation into the UK life industry missed these problems and unwisely set up the Equity Release sector as a poster child to be promoted.This Equity Release guarantee scandal raises far-reaching questions not just about the Equity Release sector and its capital inadequacy, but also about the PRA’s supervision of the sector.

Title: Critical Essays on Politics Vol.2 
Provider-Name: EconSciences Books, İstanbul
Abstract: This book consists of 6 chapters on Social Theory. It is possible to briefly summarize the content of these chapters.
The neo-institutionalisr theory on the management of common pool resources by states in erms of international regimes is based on dubious a.ssumptions about sues as players. If one starts from alternaiive assumptions about interaciion between asymmetrical players and the advantages of opportunistic behaviour, then it is easier to account for !he collective action difficulties in a regime such as the Helsinki Commission (IIELCONI), which handles the environmental problems in the Baltic Sea region.What drives a politician? The standard answer in political philosophy is Hobbes’ power, strongly supported by Max Weber. However, the emergence of the Putin regime in Russia forces us to theorize the role of economic motivation as looting. We find it in all dictatorships, e.g., Burma. The giant financial economy enhances the private prospects of looting, especially in closed societies.
The Ukraine war makes the philosophy of warfare highly relevant. But the philosophers of war are few in numbers despite the numerous war mankind has experienced. The Ukraine warfare is not rational in terms of Clausewitz’ concepts of strategy and tactics.
The United Nations’ endorsed notion of good government or governance can be analysed in a clear fashion with the concepts of rule of law – rule of law I (legality) and rule of law II (democracy). Principal-agent modelling shows how politicians and the bureaucracy can be restrained by rule of law institutions.Today there is a set of well-ordered countries to which many people would liķe to move. What is their advantage? Reply: they are well-ordered im the public and private sectors adhering to the Keynesian model of a mixed economy.
The wars in the Ukraine and Gaza have resulted in such enormous costs that the war approach to conflicts must be rejected. Theories of war are based on rational assumptions like with Sun Tsu and Clausewitz. Only Thucydides told the truth: cruelty, destruction and suffering. Given the destruction in Ukraine and Gaza as well as Israel, one may look into the peace literature for guidance (Balissa 2020).
