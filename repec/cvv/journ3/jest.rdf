Title:  Nationalist Movements in the Balkans and Ottoman Government
Abstract:  The 19th century was a century where the Balkans were reshaping by ideological and cultural polarisation. Until this century, the Ottoman Empire have maintained its multireligious, multilingual and multicultural structure without a problem. However in this century, the nationalist uprisings have caused a change in the Empire’s borders, leading to a Balkan region where Ottoman Empire has almost no presence. Notions that came with the French revolution such as freedom, motherland, nation and the policies of major European states have also affected the separation process.  It would be possible to divide Ottoman foreign policy at the time into three eras. The first era is the time until 1865 was the time where the Empire was no longer unrivalled. The second era until 1878, was the era where the Empire guaranteed its territorial integrity and independence via Paris Peace Treaty in 1856. And finally the third era between 1878 and 1908 mainly focused on the balance policies to preserve its territorial integrity. In this era where the Empire was unsettled and vulnerable against interference the policies were based on integrity of the state. Ottoman state governors have tried to attune to the European system which was formed by 1815 Vienna Congress. They have seen internal and external administration as a whole and seeked for a new political culture and identity that can coexist with traditional and western values. They have tried activating the connective power of religion and use religion as a common bonding factor against attacks from Europe. As an external policy, a balance policy that works with the rising powers of the era and makes use of the adverse interests masterfully was being followed.  After the 1877-1878 Ottoman Russian War, as a result of the immigration policies, the situation of the Muslim community was a determinant in the formation of new policies. Railways were used both as a tool of development and external policy. While keeping diplomacy in the foreground, blocks, polarisation and wars were avoided. These policies were not enough to save the state, however extended the life of it. This study primarily puts emphasis on notions related to nationalism. Furthermore it aims to explore the Balkan nationalism, which led to the end of the Ottoman Empire and characteristics of the Ottoman state policies at the time.

Title:  Analysis of Poverty Trends in Ghana
Abstract:  The analysis of poverty incidence in Ghana suggested that Ghana has made huge progress in the area of poverty reduction as the country has achieved many of the Millennium Challenge Goals (MDGs). Poverty in Ghana has trended downwards for a decade now as evidenced from Ghana Living Standard Surveys conducted since 1987 to the latest GLSS6 conducted for the period 2012/2013.Poverty at all levels has gone down in the country according evidences from the analysis of the various living standard surveys conducted in Ghana. It is expected that if Government continues to pursue its current pro-poor economic policies aimed at achieving the MDGs, then poverty levels in Ghana will even trend down further in the coming years. Government policies towards poverty reduction should continuously target the vulnerable, socially and financially excluded in the past from growth and development in the country.

Title:  Immigration in Empirical Facts and Statistics
Abstract:  In the modern world of globalization, we speak of a “global village”, but there always remain some regional fix points. Therefore we do not know exactly what role we have in the future as a society in a globalized world. The globalized world is like a small village: On the one hand, everyone knows what happens in the village, but in other hand, other social differences remain in the same sizes. Therefore in the future some components will always remain in the same form, such as poorness, richness, good, evil, war and peace. Today, prosperity of population in Western societies shows an increasing drift. But no one can guarantee that they will remain so forever in the future. The statistics and existing conflicts show that many problems in the world will always remain. Humanity will be able to realize their dreams of space only in part. And yet, many things will remain as in the Stone Age. The focus of this paper is to consider this matter from a realistic and humanistic point of view.

Title:  Baudrillard Goes to Kyiv: Institutional Simulacra in Transition
Abstract:  The transition process in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union from 1989 onward has been focused on the reform of institutions in order to re-orient the economy. However, throughout the former Soviet space, “transition” has been merely a label for many countries, covering the reality of a fundamental lack of change in either political or economic institutions. Using the idea of simulacra and simulation, first posited by philosopher Jean Baudrillard in 1981, I show how institutional change in transition for some prominent “transition economies” has proceeded through stages in simulation. In particular, using examples from Central Asia and Ukraine, I examine how crucial institutions have changed from a perversion of reality into symbols that are divorced from any reality. Current events in Ukraine show that institutional simulacra can exposed when an exogenous reality forces its way through.

Title:  Rural Perspective towards Financial Inclusion
Abstract:  Financial Inclusion or inclusive financing is the delivery of financial services at affordable costs to sections of disadvantaged and low-income segments of society, in contrast to financial exclusion where those services are not available or affordable. For the purpose of giving such financial services in easy and convenient way government has developed many financial plans in the rural areas. These plans are helpful for people who want to access financial services. The availability of banking and payment services to the entire population without discrimination is the prime objective of this public policy. Thus the term Financial Inclusion can be defined as the process of ensuring access to financial services and timely and adequate credit where needed by vulnerable groups such as weaker sections and low income groups at an affordable cost. The nations should takeover and remedy to reach the financial services to the weaker sections. So, this study has been undertaken to analyse the prospects of financial inclusion in rural areas.

Title:  Education-Economic Growth Nexus: A Review
Abstract:  This paper is focused on a review of education and economic growth relationship. It reviews both the theoretical as well as empirical literature relevant to education-economic growth nexus. The study of economic growth is an old area but addition to the determinants remained a unceasing during the history. The human capital-economic growth relationship is evident even from Adam smith theories. However, it got formal recognition in New Growth theories. The literature shows that human capital is not measurable directly; instead, some proxies are used for it. Education, health, research and development, experience and skills are some of the most commonly measures for human capital. Education as a determinant has been used extensively. Some of the studies recognize its positive role while others negative. Different levels of education showed different type of effects. It is concluded on the basis of reviewed literature that human capital in form of education affects economic growth through different channels.

Title:  Public Policy Process in Pakistan: Key causes of Public Policies Failures
Abstract:  The public policy help to address public issues to the government. Since the establishment of Pakistan, the reigning governments has failed to adopt a viable mechanism for formulation and implementation of public policies.  According to the constitution, the executive branch of the government is responsible for developing the public policy altogether with federal, provincial and local governments. Currently, after the 18th Amendment, this responsibility has been transferred to the provincial government and it further can delegate authority, powers and resource to the local governments. Every elected government has a manifesto that public the public relies on for voting. The elected governments are responsible for developing viable policies to address the public issues. But is case of Pakistan, politically elected government had always served their own interests rather than public issues. The 65 years history of Pakistan has presented very dismal situation in respect of formulation and implementation of policies. The research paper has investigated vast literature on successive government policies, and it has identified the major causes of policy failures i.e, massive corruption, insufficient financial allocations, untrained human resource, lack of vision, poor monitoring system, poor policy evaluations and centralized approach in policy implementation. The paper has identified reasons coupled with weak institutional structures and frequent political interventions due to which current policies failed to provide productive results as was desired in the policy goals.

Title:  Economic Thought in Eighteenth CenturyAmerica Prior to Indepencence
Abstract:  This paper examines the state of economic thought in the United States during the time period 1700 to 1775, an era that marks the end of the colonial age for the new nation.  This essay starts with an over view of economic conditions during the final phase of colonialism in America.  This is followed by a discussion of American economic thinking, divided into three distinct yet overlapping perspectives: (1) mainstream economic thought, which represents the dominant point of view about economics in America prior to the end of colonial status; (2) other voices, or economic perspectives focused on particular economic issues of the time and not the general state of economic thought; and (3) a crosscurrent or contrary view to mainstream economics, a way of viewing economics and economic thinking that takes exception to the popular economic paradigm of the time.

Title:  On Slavery and Libertarianism
Abstract:  There is all the world of difference between voluntary and coercive slavery.  The physical invasions might be identical in the two cases, but the ethical analysis of each is diametrically the opposite. The only problem with real world slavery was that it was compulsory; the slave did not agree to take on this role. Otherwise, slavery was not only “not so bad” it was a positive good, for both the slave and the slave-master, at least in the ex-ante sense, as is the case with all economic behavior.

Title:  Addressing Bad Management Practices in a Family Owned Oil Field Environmental Organization: A Longitudinal Case Study of a Management Turn Around
Abstract:  Bad management practices can plague any organization and can be an on-going challenge for organizations of all sizes.  In the case of Extra Environmental, Inc. (EEI), bad managementhas had a more significant impact as it permeated throughout every major department in the company.  A culture of bad management has entrenched itself at EEI, while the ownership partners operated as if bad management practices were a byproduct of the oil and gas industry. A case study, used to undertake this report was based on the uniqueness of the parameters and specific measures taken to address the challenges.  The case study identified five (5) key problems, as detailed below, that was studied, diagnosed, and addressed, to meet this case study’s objectives. This case assessed the steps employed to address the specific bad managementpractices, and to gain an understanding of what good management looks like so corrective actions can be employed to aid an organization. The strategies and activitiesundertaken in this study focused on not only fixingbad management practices, but also to create strong management functions inan organization and stabilize their workforce and grow the organization.  Cultural and change aspects were also key factors in this study in that they are foundational components that must be addressed to gain any level of success in turning around bad management practices at an organization. Thus, a compilation of diagnosis, corrective actions, change, and culture were identified as the key success factors in this study as well as the support given by many of the literature resources used in this study. It was the financial impact, as well as other major problems identified in the due diligence process, that created the rationale for this case study.

Title:  Integrating Zakah, Awqaf and IMF for Poverty Alleviation: Three Models of Islamic Micro Finance
Abstract:  The objective of this paper is to present theoretical proposals for institutional structure in the context of Islamic Microfinance by first comparing Conventional and Islamic microfinance institutions and then by highlighting some of the pioneering work of conventional microfinance models that paved the way for Islamic Microfinance. In this paper, we review the literature of micro finance models that simultaneously deals with several facets of poverty by combining Waqf and Zakah principles together or individually. There are three models examined in this paper. Waqf-Based Islamic Microfinance Institutions, a Model of Zakah and Awqaf-based MF Organizations and an Integrated Awqaf and Zakah Model of Microfinance. Both Zakah and Waqf mechanisms are considered for Islamic microfinance not only because of their frameworks that are in accordance to the Shariah but they are the original concepts provided in Islam that serve people in need i.e the poor. In tandem with the doctrine of microfinance, Zakah and Waqf are seen as tools best suited to assist the poor who require financing and ultimately could be effective for poverty reduction. The paper derives recommendation for integrating microfinance models into the overall economic policy.

Title:  Dario Azzellini (ed.), An alternative Labour History. Worker Control and Workplace Democracy
Abstract:  This book covers a wide variety of proletarian struggles to take control of the workplace from capitalists. This extends over a century - from the Austrian revolution in 1919 to recent events in Greece. It also covers theoretical questions (such as Pannekoek's council communism) to the practical issues faced by workers' cooperatives attempting to compete in the market place. The geographical spread from places as far apart as Brazil, Canada, Chile, Japan, Mexico, Italy, and Uruguay presents a little known history. Although the numerous authors do not offer a single perspective, the book posits both an alternative to parliamentary social democracy and those who ignore the working class as a factor in social transformation. Inevitably these experiences have succumbed to the surrounding capitalist environment but they point both to the persistence of striving for direct democracy and its potential as a real alternative to the current system.

Title:  Léonce Ndikumana & James K. Boyce, Africa's Odious Debts: How Foreign Loans and Capital Flight Bled a Continent
Abstract:   After a period when the discourse on capital flight was largely coined for a rhetoric aimed to feed into the Marxist argument that capitalism could not lead to the development of the Third World, the debate on capital flight has increasingly become part of mainstream economics since the 1990s. This move has been accompanied by unprecedented efforts to refine the concept of, and measurement approach to capital flight, and better understand the challenges and opportunities of capital flight curbing or reversal for developing countries. Africa’s Odious Debts is one of the outcomes of such efforts.

Title:  Transcending the Trend of Financialization: The Heterodox vs. Islamic Economics View
Abstract:  The paper aims to link three prominent issues relevant to the financial world today – the mounting level of financialization, heterodox perspective on functionless investors, and compatibility of Islamic principles to heterodox thinking particularly in regards to interest and uncertainty. Examining the vast array of burgeoning literature the paper argues that the trend of financialization in the capitalist countries has created a new class of capitalist with huge accumulation of wealth ensued merely from financial transactions. Income gap between the rich and poor has widened which is at odd with heterodox perception of equality among social classes. In the Marxian and Keynesian traditions, there is little room for functionless investors to expropriate surplus earned by working and entrepreneurial classes particularly through financing means or rent. We find Islamic prohibition of interest and uncertainty compatible with this heterodox thesis. Islam does not allow rentier income from interest; rather it encourages profit and loss sharing financial contracts so that uncertainty involving with the future income is shared by contracting parties.

Title:  The Insecure Future of the World Economic Growth
Abstract:  Growth rate of the world Growth Domestic Product (GDP) is analysed to determine possible pathways of the future economic growth. The analysis is based on using the latest data of the World Bank and it reveals that the growth rate between 1960 and 2014 was following a trajectory approaching asymptotically a constant value. The most likely prediction is that the world economic growth will continue to increase exponentially and that it will become unsustainable possibly even during the current century. A more optimistic but less realistic prediction is based on the assumption that the growth rate will start to decrease linearly. In this case, the world economic growth is predicted to reach a maximum, if the growth rate is going to decrease linearly with time, or to follow a logistic trajectory, if the growth rate is going to decrease linearly with the size of the world GDP.

Title:  The effects of monetary policy on unemployment in Namibia
Abstract:  The main purpose of the article was to establish the effects of monetary policy on unemployment in Namibia. The article used the structural VAR methodology in a macroeconometric setting to achieve this. The results show that monetary policy affects unemployment in Namibia in the short run and in the long run, it is ineffective. These results differ from the results by Alexius & Holmlund (2007) and Jacobs et al. (2003) who found that monetary policy has a significant role to play in explaining unemployment in both the short run and the long run. This means that there is still need to investigate the other explanations of long run unemployment in Namibia such as the demand and supply related variables so that appropriate policies are propounded to address it effectively.

Title:  Determination of Wages and Exchange Rate with Game Theory
Abstract:  In every country, wages are determined by Nash rule or governments determine wages. According to Nash equilibrium, policy of determination wages is respect to exchange rate and there is a game between NWC and MAS. In this paper, we survey a game theory method to survey policy of determination wages and exchange rate to stability economics. When exchange rate increases, import good's price rise and we have cost push inflation, therefore wages are increased and then we have unemployment. Then wages are determined respect to exchange rate changes. But in real world, some conditions affected on Nash equilibrium and wages are determined as non Nash method and government equals between benefits of workers and principals. In this paper, we survey wage making in Iran and reveal that in some courtiers such as Iran, government determines wages and create equilibrium in labor market.

Title:  Revisiting the Effects of Workers’ Remittances on Economic Development in Nigeria
Abstract:  Poverty in Nigeria continues unabated despite huge inflow of remittances.  Our result supports the argument that remittances can improve economic growth but can also worsen overall wellbeing.   Reasons for this are, first, remittances beneficiaries in Nigeria are concentrated in the middle income class with high propensity to consume.  Second, due to high propensity to consume, consumption triggers good prices in such a way as to worsen the purchasing power of the poor.  Third, institutions are weak and the poor do not benefit from weak institution.  Thus good quality institutions should be encouraged while ostentatious spending should be discouraged.

Title:  Norman Schofield & Gonzalo Caballero (Eds.), The Political Economy of Governance: Institutions, Political Performance and Elections
Abstract:  This edited conference volume is another from Springer on the Studies in Political Economy under the editorship of Prof. Norman Schofield, the Dr. William Taussig Professor of Political Economy Professor, Department of Political Science at Washington University. Political Economy is a fast growing field that uses the logic of economics to study issues pertaining to politics and governance and of which Prof. Schofield has been one the most prolific contributors over the last four decades. This volume brings together the papers presented at the Political Economy of Governance, Institutions and Elections workshop that took place in Baiona, Spain in April 2014. Political Economy is a vast and growing field as such this volume is only representative of the many issues and the modelling techniques—both theoretical and empirical—used to address them. The topics and issues addressed in this volume span a great variety of subjects covering—as the title indicates—issues dealing with governance, institutions and elections. The chapters in this volume are not only innovative, but they challenge and engage the reader into thinking more deeply about the issues addressed. One of the major characteristic of this volume is that most papers directly or indirectly contest the existing body of knowledge by either providing alternatives ways of thinking about a problem not addressed in the main stream literature or by studying issues that have up to know been ignored in the literature. This review is organized as follows. Section 1 gives an overview of how institutions work or change over time within a country; Section 2, those dealing with different aspects of democracy and Section 3 those dealing with the workings of elections. Concluding comments are given in Section 4.

Title:  Angelo A. Camillo (Edt.), Global Enterprise Management, Volume I: New Perspectives on Challenges and Future Developments
Abstract:  As an on-going process of integrating companies, people, and governments on an international level, globalization is driven by economic motives. International trade and investment provides opportunities for enterprises to alleviate costs, increase productivity, and compete on a global scale. Managers that lead global enterprises are faced with complex and dynamic situations for which they require practical tools and real-world solutions. Although other books have addressed globalization with respect to an individual practitioner, a relevant theory, or a particular market, Volume I brings together an international interdisciplinary team of scholars in an effort to provide a truly global perspective. Against a fragmented tapestry that makes up the current literature on global enterprise management (see international marketing/project management/human resource management for examples), the 256-page volume edited by Angelo A. Camillo, represents an ambitious attempt to bring together international talent for a collaborative effort that spans nine countries and four continents. Organized in two volumes - of which the first is herein reviewed, Global Enterprise Management showcases a collection of essays with a world-wide perspective that provides unique interpretations, theoretical considerations, and credible solutions to global enterprise managers.

Title:  The Postulate of the Three Regimes of Economic Growth Contradicted by Data
Abstract:  Economic growth in Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, countries of the former USSR, Africa and Latin America were analysed. It is demonstrated that the fundamental postulate of the Unified Growth Theory about the existence of the three regimes of growth (Malthusian regime, post-Malthusian regime and sustained-growth regime) is contradicted by data. These regimes did not exist. In particular, there was no escape from the Malthusian trap because there was no trap. Economic growth in all these regions was not stagnant but hyperbolic. Unified Growth Theory is fundamentally incorrect. However, this theory is also dangerously misleading because it claimsa transition from the endless epoch of stagnation to the new era of sustained economic growth, the interpretation creating the sense of security and a promise of prosperity. The data show that the opposite is true. Economic growth in the past was sustained and secure. Now, it is supportedby the increasing ecological deficit. The long-term sustained and secure economic growth has yet to be created. It did not happen automatically, as suggested incorrectly by the Unified Growth Theory.

Title:  What is Sustainability of Farms?
Abstract:  This paper attempts to give answer to some important questions, on which there is no agreement among researchers, namely: “what is farm sustainability?”, “what is the relation between farm and agrarian sustainability?”, “which are critical factors of farms sustainability?”, and “how to assess farms sustainability level”. First, evolution of the “concept” of farm sustainability as alternative ideology, new strategy, system characteristics etc. is analyzed and discussed. On that base is suggested adequate definition of farm sustainability as ability of a particular farm to maintain its governance, economic, social and ecological functions in a long term. The final goal is better define farm sustainability and develop an efficient framework for assessing sustainability level of different type of farms.

Title:  The Informal Aspects of the Activity of Countries Studied Through Social Accounting and Socio-Demographic Matrices
Abstract:  Approaches based on Social Accounting Matrices (SAMs) and Socio-Demographic Matrices (SDMs) will be presented as a way of capturing relevant networks of linkages and the corresponding multiplier effects, which can subsequently be used for modelling the activity of the countries to be studied. Emphasis will be placed on the activity of household unincorporated enterprises, also known as informal enterprises. Based on methodological principles derived mainly from the works of Richard Stone, this study will be developed in a matrix format, including, on the one hand, people – represented by a SDM – and, on the other hand, activities, products, factors of production and institutions – represented by a SAM. The exposition will be accompanied by an application to Portugal, in which different scenarios will be briefly presented, involving changes in incomes and expenditures. The macroeconomic effects of these changes will be summarised in the form of changes in the macroeconomic aggregates: Gross Domestic Product, Gross National Income and Disposable Income.

Title:  The Political Economy of Religion and Politics in India
Abstract:  The paper will examine the dramatic rise of the right-wing Hindu organisations in India, especially since the 1990s. Most prominent among these organisations are RSS, BJP, VHP, Bajang Dal and Shiv Sena. However, they all work together under the philosophy of Hindutva (i.e. Hindu-ness) and are rabidly anti-minority in their stance. They appear to need an ‘enemy’ in the form of a religious minority to unite Hindus and consolidate their support. This study is important because RSS is too politically significant to be ignored. Since the BJP (BhartiyaJanta Party) came to power in May 2014, its ministers and senior party leaders have been coming out in support of Hindutva. Attacks against Muslims have risen sharply. Cultural issues such as cow slaughter and the building of the Ram temple at Ayodhya have been raised again by the RSS as a means of dividing communities and keeping Muslims in a state of constant fear and insecurity. This study argues that the failure of India’s economic development to remove socio-economic constraints leading to slow and uneven development has intensified rivalry between castes and religious communities. Under such conditions, it became possible for extremist Hindu organisations to target people on the basis of religion.

Title:  Revisiting Free Market Utopia: A Hayek-Polanyi Reminder
Abstract:  As pundits discuss the causes and results of the 2008 financial crisis and ensuing Great Recession, economists of various strands—led mainly by Keynesians—are slowly beginning to question the supposed wisdom of unfettered markets. Since Keynesian-liberal disputes revolve around the symptoms of the crisis rather than the historical and structural features of market economies, we thought that a Hayek-Polanyi comparison would be a timely intervention in order to understand the real nature of the subject. This comparison may also pave the way for the creation of an alternative to the vagaries of unfettered markets.

Title:  The Socio-economic Status of Migrant Workers in Thiruvananthapuram District of Kerala, India
Abstract:  This paper examines the socio-economic condition of the migrant workers in Kerala. We analyse the income, consumption and savings pattern, and nature of work of the migrant workers in the Thiruvananthapuram district, based on data from a sample of 166 migrant workers. While existing studies provide evidences for short distance migration to Kerala from nearby states like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, we find evidence for long distance migration from states like West Bengal and Assam in recent years. We find that informal information networks through migrant workers from native place plays important role in migration of workers to Kerala. Poor economic conditions in the native place and high wage rate and better employment opportunities in Kerala have been identified as the main reasons of migration to Kerala. Though there is barely any change in the nature of employment of the migrants even after migration, there has been a shift from the low-income brackets before migration to high-income brackets after migration. Notwithstanding the improved income level the living condition for most of migrant workers is deplorable, most of them live together in either poor rented houses or work sites with one room shared by many, without proper provision of hygienic sanitation.

Title:  Intrahousehold Bargaining, Domestic Violence Laws and Child Health Development in Ghana
Abstract:  I explore a unique exogenous instrument to examine how the intra-familial position of women influence health outcomes of their children using micro data from Ghana. Using the 2SLS-IV estimation technique, I build a model of household bargaining and child health development with perceptions of women regarding wife-beating and marital rape in the existence of domestic violence laws, in Ghana. Even though the initial OLS estimates suggest that women’s participation in decisions regarding purchases of household consumption goods help to improve child health outcomes, the IV estimates reveal that the presence of endogeneity underestimates the impact of women’s bargaining power on child health outcomes. Our choice of instrument is robust to endogeneity, father characteristics and residency robustness checks.

Title:  Nomination Commitee Attributes and Firm Performance: Evidence from Finance Companies in Malaysia
Abstract:  The paper examines the impact of nomination committee attributes on the performance of finance companies in Malaysia. Our panel data is composed of annual data for finance companies listed on the main market of Bursa Malaysia over the period 2004 to 2011. The result indicates that finance expertise of directors’ on nomination committee influences accounting returns positively while membership of executive on nomination committee affects accounting returns negatively. This indicates that the requirement of Bank Negara that nomination committee should be composed of non-executive directors is appropriate and suggests that the regulators should recommend companies to include directors with finance expertise in the nomination committee in future policy formulation.

Title:  Karima Kourtit, Peter Nijkamp, & Roger Stough (Eds.), The Rise of the City: Spatial Dynamics in the Urban Century
Abstract:  Innovations and innovators who bring new products to market are heralded as change agents and are the heroes of modern business.  However, a subtle dimension in social science research has emerged which promises a similar relationship with human interaction and economic development: urban living and the rise of megacities.  For a time, new innovations in telecommunication and transportation suggested the demise of cities that would make rural living preferable to life in urban areas.  However, rather than these developments leading to the demise of cities, urban areas are now considered as the hub of economic growth and innovation, which is attributed to the international proliferation of urban living.  Cities are increasingly seen as reducing the costs of communication, create access to culture, knowledge, and medicine and are recognized as centers of innovation and productivity.  It is against this backdrop that Karima Kourtit, Peter Nijkamp, and Roger Stough have edited the volume The Rise of the City: Spatial Dynamics in the Urban Century, which synthesizes leading topics in urban economics..

Title:  Philosophical Origins of Seventeenth Century American Economic Thought
Abstract:  This paper examines the philosophical origins of seventeenth century American economic thinking, considering the contributions of both Puritan thought as derived from the abundant written legacy its followers left behind, and that of Quaker thought, which though less voluminous proved to be more influential in the long run development of American economics. Before addressing the dominant theme of this essay, the paper begins with a discussion of protohistory, a concept essential to understanding the contention that historiography has overvalued the significance of Puritanism at the expense of Quakerism.

Title:  The Unresolved Mystery of the Great Divergence is Solved
Abstract:  The so-called great divergence in the income per capita is described in the Unified Growth Theory as the mind-boggling and unresolved mystery about the growth process. This mystery has now been solved: the great divergence never happened. It was created by the manipulation of data. Economic growth in various regions is at different levels of development but it follows similar, non-divergent trajectories. Unified Growth Theory is shown yet again to be incorrect and scientifically unacceptable. It promotes incorrect and even potentially dangerous concepts. The distorted presentation of data supporting the concept of the great divergence shows that economic growth is now developing along moderately-increasing trajectories but mathematical analysis of the same data and even their undistorted presentation shows that these trajectories are now increasing approximately vertically with time. So, while the distorted presentation of data used in the Unified Growth Theory and the spuriously-created great divergence suggest the generally sustainable and secure economic growth, the undistorted presentation of data demonstrates that the growth is unsustainable and insecure. Similar dangerously incorrect concept promoted by the Unified Growth Theory is the repeated doctrine of takeoffs from the hypothetical but non-existent stagnation to growth. They also suggest prosperous and secure future. Such takeoffs never happened but even without them the current economic growth is insecure.

Title:  Moving Towards a Circular Economy: Rethinking Waste Management Practices
Abstract:  Nowadays waste has become a vital part of our economy, as a by-product of economic activity. It originates from businesses, the government and households and following appropriate management techniques, it can be used as an input to economic activity for instance through material or energy recovery. Waste is produced by all activities and although it is a locally arising problem it has both local and global effects. Societies need to dispose their waste products creating a source of environmental pollution. Sustainable waste management requires the combination of skills and knowledge of physical sciences and engineering together with economics, ecology, human behaviour, entrepreneurship and good governance. This paper discusses extensively the policy framework and the legislative background around waste and its management in the EU and worldwide. In this way, it focuses on the treatment options for waste under the Circular Economy approach having in mind the idea of closing the loop and hence achieving a more efficient use of resources.

Title:  The Balance of Economics and Political Science in Islamic Political Economy
Abstract:  The purpose of this paper is to investigate the balance of economics and political science in Islamic political economy. The economic science here refers to economics value based on Islamic teaching, while political science refers to political value based on Islam. Whereas Islamic political science is a field that evaluates the interaction between the Islamic economy and politics as well as the implication of the influences of one field on the other.Beyond this assessment, between the economic and political value, which one is more influential in Islamic political economy? To date, most scholars are inclined towards the influence of their respective field. For those in economic field, the focus of Islamic political economy is mostly directed towards economic value rather than political value.Similarly, those who are in politics will be more inclined towards the political value rather than economic.Thus, which of the political or economic value should be made priority in Islamic political economy? Based on literature review and textual analysis, this paper will firstly, re-evaluate the issue where it is perceived that Islamic political economy does not necessarily need to focus on both political and economic value; secondly, analyse the extent to which the economic and political values are needed in Islamic political economy; and thirdly, summarise the option between the economic and political value in Islamic political economy in order to achieve a holistic field of study in overcoming problems and presenting solution for the political economy of the Ummah (Islamic nation).

Title:  Rögnvaldur Hannesson, Debt, Democracy and the Welfare State: Are Modern Democracies Living on Borrewed Time and Money
Abstract:  This book deals with the accumulation of government debt in twenty-two of the richest countries of the world, which has been ongoing since about the mid-1970s. All these countries are welfare states with a large government sector that provides services and transfers purchasing power to the perceived needy, although some countries are more ambitious in this respect than others. The build-up of debt is due to maintaining welfare expenditures beyond what tax revenues allow. But indefinite debt accumulation is not an option. The question is whether the governing elites in democratic countries will shrink from doing what is necessary in fear of losing their electorate, in the end opening the way to unenlightened populists and potential usurpers.

This is a more severe penalty given to drug dealers, and even murderers. Is he heroic for violating an unjust law, which makes selling drugs a victimless crime? Is he a libertarian?

Title:  Race, Capitalism, and Power: The Economic Thought of the Young Jesse Jackson
Abstract:  Fifty years ago, Jesse Jackson joined the S.C.L.C. and rose rapidly to become one of this country’s major advocates of black capitalism. Far less well known is his interest in finance and credit for African Americans that suggests his prescience about the decline of industrial capitalism. Focusing on Jackson’s early civil rights activity in Chicago, this paper charts the initial stages through which Martin Luther King’s young pupil rapidly became a staunch supporter of black economic power, strongly committed to a wealth-transfer agenda, while most of the other civil rights and labor leaders showed more interest in a just distribution of income. Abandoning the stereotypical image of Jackson in his early years, an image limiting him to an ambitious activist interested in bargains and with little inclination for analysis of the economic reality of his times, this paper addresses Jackson’s forward way of thinking. His growing expertise in money and finance made him one of the few civil rights leaders who genuinely grasped the functioning of the post-industrial economy and constituted the true wellspring of his later pan-Africanism and economic policies.

Title:  An Introduction to Alternative Methods in Program Impact Evaluation
Abstract:  During the recent years, researchers as well as policy makers have been increasingly interested in impact evaluation of development programs. A large number of impact evaluations have been developed and applied to measure the impact of programs. Different impact evaluation methods rely on different identification assumptions. This paper presents an overview of several widely-used methods in program impact evaluation. In addition to a randomization-based method, these methods are categorized into: (i) methods assuming “selection on observable” and (ii) methods assuming “selection on unobservable”. The paper discusses each method under identification assumptions and estimation strategy. Identification assumptions are presented in a unified framework of counterfactual and two-equation model.

Title:  Complex Factors Behind Misguided Policies in Socioeconomics: From Mass Migration and Persistent Alienation to Rampant Crime and Economic Malaise
Abstract:  In a complex and chaotic world, people often gloss over the facts and jump to conclusions. Unfortunately, the hasty approach usually yields deficient and even harmful results. The domains affected range from migration and poverty to alienation and crime. According to the Myth of Boon, for instance, immigrants always benefit the host society. In this light, many people envisage the great migrations of the 19th century from Europe to America. However, the United States at that stage was itself a developing country; moreover the Civil War showed that clashing cultures cannot co-exist. Meanwhile the Myth of Multiculturalism asserts that a mashup of mores is always desirable; but the reality is otherwise. When immigrants in their millions pour into sparsely populated districts, they end up replicating the cultures that caused them to flee their homelands in the first place. The upshot is disruptive and distressing for all parties be they newcomers or incumbents. In addition, the Myth of Virtue declares that migrants of all backgrounds are equally upright. Yet comprehensive studies in Sweden have shown that violent crimes can be traced to immigrants at rates which are at least four times those for natives. From another angle, a drove of migrants is a godsend for criminals. For instance, a terrorist ring struck in France in 2015 and again in Belgium the following year. The perpetrators – who grew up in Belgium, France and Sweden – displayed immigrant backgrounds and included part of the cohort that traveled to the Mideast to receive training from militants then returned to Europe by posing as refugees. Since socioeconomic problems are intertwined rather than independent, a piecemeal approach will not fill the bill. Instead, a coherent grasp of the issues and their tie-ups is a prerequisite for devising a wholesome solution.

Title:  Islamic finance for SMES
Abstract:  Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) make up the bulk of the economic tissue of the economy. In developing countries, they represent the majority of employment, including female employment. Investing in SMEs is a long-term and smart strategy, with sustainable returns that multiply across regions, countries and societies. SMEs constitute the overwhelming majority of firms. Globally, SMEs make up over 95% of all firms, account for approximately 50% of GDP and 60%–70% of total employment, when both formal and informal SMEs are taken into account. This amounts to between 420 million and 510 million SMEs, 310 million of which are in emerging markets. Promoting access to finance for SMEs has been on the global reform agenda since the global financial crisis. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the opportunities of development and growth as well as the main challenges to Islamic finance for SMEs. This paper will help to deepen understanding of the concepts of Islamic finance as well as SMEs. In addition to evaluate how Islamic financial institutions can support SMEs.

Title:  A Holistic Approach for Assessing the System of Governance of Agrarian Sustainability
Abstract:  Despite its importance research on the governance of agrarian sustainability is still at the beginning stage due to the “newness” of the problem, emerging new challenges, fundamental modernization during recent years, “lack” of long-term experiences and relevant data, application of narrow (certain form or management level); one-dimensional, unisectioral, normative, without transaction costs etc. approaches. The goal of this paper is to suggest a modern and practical framework for analyzing and assessing the system of governance of agrarian sustainability. New interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated and agrarian sustainability property defined, principle mechanisms and modes of governance (institutions, market, private, public, hybrid). of agrarian sustainability classified, and a holistic approach for identifying components and factors, assessing efficiency, and improving the system of governance presented. Suggested framework is to be further discussed and improved while its application requires new type of micro and macro-economic data for agrarian agents’ preferences and behavior, activities and efficiency of farming organizations, effects and impacts on social, community and natural environment, etc.

Title:  Seyed Kazem Sadr, The Economic System of the Early Islamic Period: Institutions and Policies
Abstract:  The book is a major contribution to Islamic economic history and to Islamic economics in the English language. It presents a comprehensive yet concise economic hermeneutic of policies implemented by the Messenger (saas) in Medinah. It is an authoritative presentation based on the Qur’an, the Traditions of the Messenger, earliest writings of Muslim historians and jurists. Within the context of contemporary economic universe of discourse, the book discusses implications of policies of the Messenger with regards to allocation of resources, production, exchange, growth, development, environment, efficiency and justice. For those who think that zakat, prohibition against interest, waqf and the like are the only elements that distinguish an Islamic economy from other systems, the depth and the breadth of the book would provide a transformative experience. This Review argues that the appearance of the book is particularly timely given the distorted, dis-embedded, and fictitious model of an Islamic economy manufactured by Orientalists. The book will go a long way in correcting these distortions.

Title:  University Institutional Research and Student Recruitment Performance: Utilizing Marketing Communication for Knowledge Heterogeneity
Abstract:  Institutional research constantly generate useful but heterogeneous knowledge for university administrations. Thus the effectiveness of institutional research dependes on the communication of those heterogeneous knowledge to major stakeholders (e.g., parents, students, teachers, etc.). A conceptual paper is developed in regards to the influences of institutional research, word-of-mouth (via internal students and faculties), quality signaling (to external prospect students and stakeholders as potential customers), and customer relationship management, on student recruitment performance as a special form of customer decision. Grounded on the marketing communication perspective, we propose that the student recruitment performance is largely affected by word-of-mouth, quality signaling, and customer relationship management as strategic marketing communications, which are facilitated by institutional research. Institutional research is interpreted as a strategic marketing tool that can help identify, communicate, and visualize the strengths of a university. The conceptual model contributes to the search for marketing mechanisms through which institutional research can generate impact to external stakeholders. Formal propositions and their implications for future, larger-scaled surveys were discussed.

Title:  Sociological Inequality and the Second Law
Abstract:  There are two fair ways to distribute particles in boxes. The first way is to divide the particles equally between the boxes. The second way, which is calculated here, is to score fairly the particles between the boxes. The obtained power law distribution function yields an uneven distribution of particles in boxes. It is shown that the obtained distribution fits well to sociological phenomena, such as the distribution of votes in polls and the distribution of wealth and Benford's law.

Title:  Integrating the Concepts of Global Freedom: Economics versus Society
Abstract:  The paper carries out a context specific debate on why the real sector of the economy is important to look into to establish a framework of effective development. While doing that the paper highlights that the economic policy in the real sector is to be complemented by intervening in the progress of the society by developing social, political and legal institutions. This paper presents a post Washington consensus intellectual debate that eventually made the Prelog for first Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) and now Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Title:  Waqf for Poverty Alleviation: Challenges and Opportunities
Abstract:  This Study seeks to adapt the framework practiced by various MDBs particularly international Development Association (IDA) to the potential establishment of GobalWaqf fund as this framework is proven to be effective. The framework revolves around the IDA operations with replenishments, allocation of funds by implementing specific formulas and the determination approach which is mainly to monitor effectiveness of the earlier processes. Apart from this framework, it is suggested that a good governance system also plays a vital role in the raising and managing of the global waqf funds. This research is purely qualitative in nature by studying the mechanisms used in IDA and other MDBs and drawing their examples and experiences. The lessons learnt are meant to complement further the fundamentals of Waqf. This study finally proposes indicators that integrate with the targets of an Islamic vision of development, which could facilitate the allocation of funds. The steps to raise funds for global waqf fund are also proposed with the objective of creating more effective approach for raising of funds for a global Waqf fund.

Title:  Analyzing Tax Policy and Economic Growth by Using Semi-Parametric Approach
Abstract:  Due to complexities in measuring the impact of tax policy on economic growth, there is need to explore functional relationship between response and predictors. Semi-parametric approaches are often very handy in modeling relationships which are non-linear but cant be completely described either through parametric or non-parametric approaches. To determine the effects of tax policy on economic growthfunctional, cubic smoothing spline method is used along with cross validation test to control the smoothing parameter. To replace the functional form of smoothing coefficients into linear mixed model, maximum likelihood estimation is used. Results indicate that proposed methodology is robust in determining functional form and in achieving increasing average marginal tax rates has negative impact on economic growth results. Empirical results indicate that high AMTRs and population growth rate reduce the performance of economic growth in the developing countries. A reduction on dependence of AMTRs in South Asian countries is needed.

Title:  Socio-cultural Evolution, Institutionalized Dispositions, And Rational Expressive Behavior
Abstract:  This paper explores the possibility of grounding human behavior in a social space and characterizing it as a rational expressive, norm-guided behavior based on institutionalized dispositions under bounded rationality. For this purpose, we first review critically the three major theories of cultural evolution, namely, Adam Smith's theory of moral sentiments, Veblen's theory of leisure class, and Bourdieu's theory of habitus and distinction, in order to abstract the common core that provides a basis on which to build a theory of rational expressive behavior under the constraints of economic factors, information flow, social sanctions, and psychological satisfaction. In particular, the paper addresses the following questions: (1) how preferences turn into institutionalized dispositions through habituation, (2) how a socio-economic order evolves as a product of institutionalized dispositions, cultural capital of life-styles, expressive symbolism, and social norms, (3) how social want emerges as a convoluted want reconstituted of social facts of life-styles and desire for upper status identification, (5) how is the behavior based on this want related to the bounded rationality in problem solving. Our inquiry will show that human behavior embedded in a socio-cultural context can be characterized as rational behavior seeking symbolic profits defined by the social want satisfying capacity of choice objects, and that such rational behavior is the source of predictable behavior that can serve as a medium of cultural evolution.

Title:  Population and Economic Growth in Australia: 8,000 BC - AD 1700 Extended to 60,000 BC
Abstract:  Data for the number of rock-shelter sites in Australia between 1000 and 10,000 years BP (before present or approximately between 8,000 BC and AD 1000) are analysed. These data were interpreted by Johnson and Brook (2011) as representing the growth of population. Their claim of the Mid-Holocene intensification of the growth of population around 5000 years BP is contradicted by their own data. The puzzle of the Mid-Holocene turning point has been solved: there was no turning point. Their claim of the Mid-Holocene turning point relies on a precise position of a single point in the set of the already inaccurate data. Based on the fitted distribution to the data, the size of human population has been estimated between 8,000 BC and AD 1700 and tentatively extended down to 60,000 BC. The absolute values of the size of population were determined in relation to Maddison’s data between AD 1 and 1700 (Maddison, 2010). Data of Maddison show also that the value of income per capita was constant below AD 1700. Using this information and the fit to the population data, economic growth in Australia was estimated down to 8,000 BC and tentatively extended to 60,000 BC.

Title:  Freedom Budget for all Americans and Economic Equality
Abstract:  The Freedom Budget for All Americans, written under the supervision of Bayard Rustin and released in 1966 by the A. Philip Randolph Institute, was a well developed policy program to secure full economic citizenship for all Americans thanks to an unprecedented government investment. The program challenged the classic definition of civil rights and linked increased government spending to economic justice.  It never earned traction and remained at the margins of historical memory by the end of the Johnson Presidency. The recent literature on the Freedom Budget focuses on its ideological milieu and political implications and identifies the strategic errors in coalition building as the main cause of the Freedom Budget defeat. This paper concentrates on a specific element of the plan, the notion of economic equality, and states that the disagreement between radicals and liberals on such a notion ultimately caused the undoing of the coalition.

Title:  The Cause of War and Role of People by Karl Polanyi: A Change in Realm of International Relations after The Great Transformation
Abstract:  The enormous impacts of WWI, WWII, and the Great Depression made Karl Polanyi write a famous book, The Great Transformation (TGT). In it, he wrote about the 'collapse of nineteenth-century civilisation', and clarified the causes and development of civilisation from the perspective of international relations and economic history. ‘Nineteenth-century civilisation’ is located in the centre of his international relations theory, and his ‘institutional system’ comprises of four elements: 1) a self-regulating market, 2) balance-of-power, 3) the international gold standard, 4) and the liberal state. In addition economic thought, Polanyi continued developing his international relations theory in Britain as evidenced by examination of a fresh record, a short booklet issued by the Worker’s Educational Association in the 1940s just after the publication of TGT. First, Polanyi emphasises the political and geographic causes of war instead of economic causes.TGT explains war arises from financial problems, especially the abandonment of the international gold standard system. On the other hand, ‘power vacuum’ is stressed as the origin of war in the booklet. While his civilisation theory presumes the political expansion of each country, the power vacuum theory does not make this supposition. This implies a change in his view to an unwanted war arising from a breakdown in the balance of power. In addition, he described diplomatic alliances as a method to prevent wars. To prevent war, Polanyi insists that people need to be engaged in civil society. This explains his belief that democracy achieved by national integrity is sovereign in our society. Informed citizens can consider government and other authorities imperfect without repercussion and still work towards national unity. Following this logic, socialism is neither centralised nor repressive, but is composed by citizens as a liberal institution.

Title:  Information Theoretic Approach to Social Networks
Abstract:  We propose an information theoretic model for sociological networks. The model is a micro canonical ensemble of states and particles. The states are the possible pairs of nodes (i.e. people, sites and alike) which exchange information. The particles are the energetic information bits. With analogy to bosons gas, we define for these networks’ model: entropy, volume, pressure and temperature. We show that these definitions are consistent with Carnot efficiency (the second law) and ideal gas law. Therefore, if we have two large networks: hot and cold having temperatures TH and TC and we remove Q energetic bits from the hot network to the cold network we can save W profit bits. The profit will be calculated from W< Q (1-TH/TC), namely, Carnot formula. In addition it is shown that when two of these networks are merged the entropy increases. This explains the tendency of economic and social networks to merge.

Title:  Engendering the Welfare State: How Fa(i)r Are the Scandinavian Welfare States
Abstract:  Welfare state or state social provision is perceived as interventions by the state in civil society to alter social forces, including male dominance.  A gender-neutral welfare state is not possible on the contrary gendered assumptions constitute the backbone of the welfare state regimes. Feminists have contributed to the literature immensely and categorization of welfare states from a gender-aware perspective has become a rich field that answers “what type of social security system with which assumptions, priorities and with what type of society provision?”  The paper discusses the reform agenda and feminist welfare state utopia, “the real utopia”, in which both men and women can perform as autonomous, free individuals in the public and private spheres. In this regard, the Scandinavian states are far ahead compared to the rest of the world in terms of reforms undertaken, yet the question remains: Is the Scandinavian case a blueprint for “the Real Utopia”? The paper aims to answer this question primarily by presenting feminist economists concerns on welfare state regulations, the suggested reform agenda, secondly by analyzing and evaluating Scandinavian model in a historical and conceptual context.

Title:  Knowledge-based View in the Franchising Research Literature
Abstract:  This study was conducted to understand the state of research on applications of Knowledge-based View in franchise systems. First, we used SALSA (Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, and Analysis), a simple systematic data search method, to obtain 61 sample papers. Second, the citations of authors and publications were analyzed using the bibliometric method to understand the authors and the publications that had the most impact as well as the trend of current studies in the field of knowledge-based theory application in franchise systems. The results showed that the journals that had the most publications on the topic were Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice and Journal of Business Research; the most cited author was S.A. Shane, who had an average rate of 1.016 citations per article, and the most cited study was a paper published by Darr, Argote, & Epple (1995), which was cited by 18 of the 61 sample papers (18/61, 29.51%). Third, we categorized the topic of knowledge-based theory application in franchise systems into six categories, i.e., knowledge transfer, knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, knowledge application, organizational learning, and knowledge exchange, to provide references for future studies.

Title:  Consumprion and Islam: Micro Foundations and Macro Modelling
Abstract:  Function in Islamic economics. It starts with a brief look at the microelements of the concept and clears several cobwebs concerning wants and needs, scarcity of resources, the basket of goods, and the efficacy of utility and its maximization for consumer equilibrium. The explanations narrow down the conceptual gaps between the micro and macro level articulations of the subject. Next, the paper reviews some selected macro models resting on division of income on the basis of nisab between the upper (rich) and the lower (poor) classes of society for analyzing the impact of zakah-moderation mechanism on economic growth via the saving-investment route. It is demonstrated that, contrary to the claim based on models, the positive impact of Islamic scheme on the variables studied is uncertain, to put it mildly. Finally, attention is drawn to some recent developments in the treatment of consumption in economics as also to interest being shown in the subject in other social sciences. This inter-disciplinary approach seeks to detach consumption from income and links it to wealth. It also brings in environmental and ethical concerns into the picture. The effort promises to bring the treatment of consumption closer in the two economic disciplines, secular and Islamic: it is a welcome development.

Title:  Demographic Catastrophes Did Not Shape the Growth of Human Population or the Economic Growth
Abstract:  Rigorous analysis of demographic catastrophes shows that, individually, they were too weak to shape the growth of human population and of the associated economic growth. On average, only 6.5% of all major demographic catastrophes, associated with the death toll larger than or equal to one million, were potentially strong enough to cause perhaps a minor change in the growth trajectory of the world population, but as shown by the population data, they did not produce any noticeable disturbance. The absence of impacts of demographic catastrophes on the growth of population can be explained not only by their low relative intensity but also by the strong and efficient regenerating process recorded for the first time by Malthus. There was, however, one unusual event manifested in the convergence of five, major demographic catastrophes. They have caused a minor and short-lasting change in the growth trajectory of the world population, which, however, was soon counteracted by the process of regeneration. This analysishows that the dominant force controlling the growth of human population was too strong to be influenced in any substantial way by accidental forces. As explained in an earlier publication, this strong and dominant force driving the growth of population was the force of procreation, which was approximately constant per person, the force expressed as a difference between the ever-present, biologically-controlled,force of sex drive and the ever-present and also biologically-controlled process of aging and dying.

Title:  Hindutva, Neoliberalism and the Reinventing of India
Abstract:  The 2014 parliamentary election in India reduced Congress party to merely 44 seats in the lower house, big blow for a party whose history is integral the country’s founding narrative. In the last parliamentary election the Congress party polled only 19.3% of the votes declining from 28.6% in 2009, while on the other hand the main right wing party i.e. BJP won 282 parliamentary seats and 31% of the national votes. The extreme right-wing organisations have undoubtedly become the central pole of Indian politics. Moreover, its recent success in Uttar Pradesh provincial election, which is one of the most populated province with 215 million inhabitants, is the strongest evidence yet of the broader shift to the right and the BJP’s victory in UP state strengthens this shift. This paper intends to study the recent rise of extreme right-wing Hindu organisations in India. Most prominent among these organisations are RSS, BJP, VHP, Bajang Dal and Shiv Sena. However, all of them work together under the philosophy of Hindutva (i.e. Hindu-ness) and are rabidly anti-minority in their stance. The aim of this study is to highlight the recent rise in extreme right-wing Hindu organisations and to examine their ideas and philosophy regarding Indian history and culture. It is also useful to set this against a global context in which divisive and ultra-nationalist forces are on the rise within Europe and Donald Trump has assumed the US presidency. The study argues that the adoption of neoliberal economic policy in 1991 has increased GDP, but hardly any expansion in employment, which is known as ‘jobless growth’. The study also finds the far right encroachment into India’s liberal institutions and it seems that Indian polity is undergoing a historically unprecedented change with extreme-right to dominance into vast areas of ideology, economy and culture.

Title:  Currency Demand, the Subterranean Economy and Tax Evasion: The Case of Tanzania
Abstract:  This paper estimates the magnitude of, and changes to the subterranean economy in Tanzania, as well as its adverse effect on tax revenue during the 1966-2015 period. To achieve this objective, the paper applies currency -ratio due to Gutmann and the traditional currency-demand approach à la Tanzi. Despite their differences, both approaches suggest the existence of a substantial size of the subterranean economy in Tanzania. This persistent large size of the subterranean economy is an important consequence of economic and social policies over the period of study. Using the currency-demand approach, the paper finds that tax evasion is positively correlated with the size and growth of the subterranean economy. Indeed, results show that the size of the subterranean economy and the magnitude of tax evasion over the 1966-2015 period, are on average, 32.7 percent and 6.6 percent of official GDP respectively. The implication of the results is that minimization of the size of the subterranean economy is necessary for effective addressing the problem of tax evasion and subsequent fiscal deficit in the long run.

Title:  The Cause and Effects of Word of Mouth from Consumer Intention and Behavior Perspectives: A SEM Model Approach
Abstract:  As word-of-mouth (WOM)has been a major issue in the Consumer research, a lot of independent variables as WOM’s causes and effects have been accumulated. However, they have not been considered systematically in one identical model, in order to compare across their relative effects. This paper adopted a structural equation modeling method to incorporate significant variables with an integrative framework of consumer intention and behavior. Theoretical and practical insights were offered via the results of analyses.

Title:  Do Institutions and Social Capital matter in the Economic Development of Nigeria?
Abstract:  This paper addresses the impact of institutions and social capital on economic development of Nigeria. It advanced an argument that economic prosperity of a country is embedded in social organizations and transformations of her institutions built from social capital. The methodology adopted was quantitative and qualitative. The results present a declining negative impact of social capital and institutional variables on economic development; affirming the importance of social capital on institutional quality. Therefore, the way forward is taking a tougher stance against abuse of power and employ mechanism of social capital to reconcile conflict among social, political and economic interest groups.

Title:  Socio-economic and Ecological Sustainability of Smallholder Agricultural Holdings in Bulgaria
Abstract:  The issue of adequate assessment of socio-economic and ecological sustainability of divers agricultural holdingsis among most topical academic and practical problems. It is particularly important for smallholder farms accounting for the majority of all farms in the globe. In Bulgaria unregistered farms of Natural Personsaccount for almost 98% of all farms in the country, cultivate a third of all farmlands, graze 85% of cows, 90% of sheep, and around a third of pigs, and employ almost 93% of workforce in the sectors. This article applies a holistic framework and assesses sustainability of farms of Natural Persons in Bulgaria during current stage of EU CAP implementation. Initially a new governance aspect of farm sustainability is justified and method outlined. After that assessment is made of integral, governance, economic, social, environmental sustainability of farms of Natural Persons of different size, specialization, and location, and comparative sustainability to other type of farms. Finally, directions for further research and amelioration of sustainability assessment practices are suggested. Overall sustainability of Natural Persons in the country is at a good level, with superior levels for environmental and social sustainability, close to the low level governance sustainability, and inferior economic sustainability. Comparative sustainability of holdings is lower than other juridical type. There are great variations in sustainability levels of farms of different kind and location. Share of Natural Persons with good and high sustainability is smaller than other categories of farms and majority of Natural Persons have no comparative advantages in terms of sustainability, and in a middle term will cease to exist.

Title:  Technological change as intelligent, energy-maximizing adaptation
Abstract:  The picture of technological change over the last 70 years in the global economy is ambiguous, with two salient facts: Total Factor Productivity has been systematically falling since 1979, whilst the average global food deficit has been systematically declining since 1992. Building upon those two fundamental facts, this article develops and verifies empirically a model, where technological change is a function of intelligent adaptation, which maximizes the appropriation of energy from the environment. Empirical research presented in the article suggests that food deficit is a powerful spur of technological change, and the loop between said change and appropriation of energy works is the most visible in societies with such deficit. As the human civilisation has managed to cut the average food deficit by half, since 1992, whist doubling population, we might be, right now, at the historical peak of intensity in technological change.

Title:  Contribution of individual social preferences on the propensity to cooperate: Lessons from an experimental study
Abstract:  Axelrod (1992) highlighted the important role of cooperation in actors’ strategy and performance in the social interactions. This importance is confirmed by Thépot (1998). The understanding of individual propensity to cooperate is an important field to better know their strategies and the performance of the economic systems’ in which they evolve. In this sense, game theory indicates that individual’s propensity to cooperate depends on his anticipation of decision that will be made by other participants and his expected gain. The challenge of this assumption based on experimental study generated other motivations to individual decision. An individual can be motivated by altruism, reciprocity, inequity aversion, …these motivations, other than self-pecuniary interest, form the social preferences theory which opened the way to other reading of individual propensity to cooperate within organizations. A better understanding of the influence of these social preferences on the decisions to cooperate (or not) within organizations have motivated this research. It relies on data collected through an experimental study which allowed the identification of the motivations (altruism, desire of reciprocity, inequity aversion,…) which best characterize individual social preferences and to study its influence on the contributions made in public good game. It concludes that the presence of rational selfish persons only motivated by pecuniary gain is the cause of cooperation’s declining within organizations and that individuals motivated by an inequity aversion have some resilience when they experiment a lack of cooperation from other organizations members. It therefore establishes that an individual social preference influence his propensity to cooperate within organization. As well, in addition to other determinants found in the literature, the conclusions of this research underline the role of social preferences in the functioning and the dynamics of organizations.

Title:  Federalism and the Arab League: A theoretical synergy
Abstract:  The paper is a theoretical analogy of the Arab league as a regional organization. The paper also discusses the objectives, strengths and weaknesses of the league. By adopting descriptive-historical research from library instrument, findings show that, there is no doubt that the league had recorded some appreciable level of achievements since its inception and there have equally been some challenges along the line. The paper concludes that, the Arab league must find a way to reduce the perpetual tension and violence in Palestine by working towards enthroning a peaceful relationship with Israel while retaining their cultural identity. The paper also recommends that, the Arab league should strengthen their relationship with the non-Arab Nations especially in the face of globalization to reap the benefits therein involved as a league. Arab league must ensure that Arab states stop waging needless wars between and among themselves. The Syria and Yemeni crises among others is a disgrace to the Arab world.

Title:  A report of Mongolia’s renewal capital
Abstract:  In a dynamically changing world, a major part of a nation’s competitiveness comes from its capacity of renewing itself to fit the global environment. Those resources that constitute the foundation of such capacity is called renewal capital of a nation. Multiple indicators and measures of renewal capital of Mongolia were analyzed and reported here in this present paper. We found that: first, Mongolia needs more regular, large-scale data collection in regard to its national renewal capital, in order to know the directions of improvement and investment; second, while R&D spending and patent usage of businesses need to be stimulated more, scientific publication has potential to grow and contribute to renewal. These results shed lights on the policy making and business practices.

Title:  Impact of cultural factors on enterprise resource planning
Abstract:  Organizational culture can also be evaluated as an application stage for the processes and fixations that occur with communication. The lack of cooperation at the desired level may lead to a decrease in effectiveness, especially at the points where teamwork is required, and to a slower implementation. This is one of the most important factors especially for the common purpose and goal setting and for the generations of the application schedules to be generic. The expected cultural change with the ERP system in the company is that the communication and monitoring needs between the units can be met depending on the integration between the processes. During the installation, inter-departmental communication is one of the processes that must be carried out in different dimensions. However, it may be possible to provide mutual optimization between the processes and share the inconveniences. Thus, problems and methods of solution is collected in a common pool will provide opportunity to access the desired point on the same technical jargon and also potential problems the same communication language means in the other unit able to resolve this quickly and both costs and expected benefits. We can summarize the purpose of the research under the heading below: Determine the positive or negative relationships of the cultural factors required for more effective and successful ERP establishment. It can help to ensure that found relationships are taken into consideration in project planning for establishing business and consulting entities. Identifying Cultural Factors for ERP implementations as a guide to management and setting out the performance measurement system for ERP.

Title:  Differential approach and capabilities: An analysis for the population displaced in Colombia
Abstract:  The conceptual framework of the capability approach proposed by Amartya Sen has never been used specifically in the dynamics of forced displacement or in the analysis of the quality of life of the population victims of the Colombian armed conflict. Reason why, this article affirms that the approach of capabilities agrees with the differential approach proposed by the Colombian Constitutional Court. Consequently, the objective is to provide a conceptual aproximation to the capability approach of Amartya Sen and differential approach proposed by the from Colombia Constitutional Court and to point out that the capability approach is relevant in the design, implementation and evaluation of public policies directed at the victim population. Similarly, recent data on the dynamics of forced displacement in the city of Bucaramanga (Colombia) are provided.

Title:  Missing the Peace Train in 2006: Economic and political dynamics of India Pakistan hostility?
Abstract:  The paper discusses the dynamics of peace initiatives made by Pakistan in 2006 and their importance in changing the regional dynamics in favour of increased economic cooperation in the light of the study undertaken by Murshed & Mamoon (2007) which has analysed the multiple determinants of conflict between India and Pakistan. The paper highlights the importance of peace in the region especially for Pakistan where the development potential of the country have been stifled greatly due to a long history of political and economic volatility while linking Pakistan’s progress with that of its neighbours through conflict mitigation process. The paper also presents the possibility of such dyadic economic and conflict trade off in 1990s where India may have utilised hostilities to curtail Pakistani economic potential to pressurise Pakistan to forego its support of insurgency in Indian held Kashmir. Pakistani peace initiatives in 2006 made the country as a leading factor in South Asia with a valid possibility of determining the pace and potential to realise long sought process of regional progress through greater integration of interests. However, the tangible response from Indian side was not forthcoming leading to loss of opportunities and thus creating a good explanation of Hawkish Indian behaviour 10 years down the time line in 2017.

Title:  Almost equi-marginal principle based composite index of globalization: China, India and Pakistan
Abstract:  The present study proposes an alternative method to construct an index of globalization which is based on the principle of almost equi-marginal contributions (AEMC) or Shapley values of the constituent variables to the overall index rather than the correlation coefficients among the constituent variables and the overall index (the KOF index based on the principal component scores). This has been done by minimization of the Euclidean norm of the Shapley values of the constituent variables. As an exercise, secondary time series data (1970-2013) on the measures of globalization in three different dimensions (economic, social and political) of three economies (China, India and Pakistan) have been used. A comparison of the AEMC index with the KOF index reveals that while the former is more inclusive, the latter is more elitist in matters of inclusion of the weakly correlated constituent variables in the overall (composite) index.  As a consequence, the AEMC index is more sensitive than the KOF index of globalization. Both indices capture the trends in globalization in the countries under study and are highly correlated between themselves. Thus, AEMC is an alternative or perhaps a better method to construct composite indices.

Title:  Explaining the Origin of the Anthropocene and Predicting Its Future
Abstract:  New interpretation of the Anthropocene is presented, the interpretation based on the rigorous analysis of the growth of human population and of economic growth in the past 2,000,000 years, which are found to have been hyperbolic. The Anthropocene appears to transcends the geological epochs of Pleistocene and Holocene. Anthropogenic impacts evolved over a long time on the canvas of hyperbolic growth of population. There were probably various stages of the Anthropocene in the past 2,000,000 years or even over a longer time. The current stage is distinctly different because now, for the first time in human existence, we are shaping our global future and even the future of our planet. This modern stage of the Anthropocene is characterised by the rapid growth of population, rapid economic growth, rapid consumption of natural resources and rapidly increasing impacts on the environment. All these features can be easily explained by characteristic properties of hyperbolic growth. Hyperbolic distributions are slow over a long time and fast over a short time. The origin of the Anthropocene can be explained as the natural consequence of hyperbolic growth of population. The mechanism of the Anthropocene can be also explained by referring to the mechanism of the growth of population. The beginning of the current stage of the Anthropocene is difficult or maybe even impossible to determine because anthropogenic impacts are likely to have been increasing monotonically. The future of the Anthropocene, which is also our future, is uncertain because it is dictated by many critical anthropogenic trends, but notably because the size of the world population is predicted to continue to increase at least until the end of the current century to a possibly unsustainable level and because the world economic growth follows now an unsustainable trajectory. Effects of the current human activities might affect global ecosystems for a long time into the future but we might not be there to see them.

Title:  The Effect of Inward Foreign Direct Investment on Economic Growth in Chinese Provinces
Abstract:  This article examines the effect of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth with a focus on Chinese provinces by conducting the Granger causality and impulse response tests in a vector auto-regression (VAR) estimation. The study contributes to the reviewed literature by examining the FDI effect in such comprehensive ways as demand-side and supply-side models, and by clearing the endogeneity problem of targeted variables under a VAR framework. The main findings of this study were as follows. First, the positive effect of FDI on economic growth in Chinese provinces was confirmed by all the model estimations: statistical, demand-side and supply-side models. Second, from the regional perspectives, the positive effect of FDI on economic growth was found in the eastern region, but not in the non-eastern region. Third, no crowding-out effect of FDI on domestic capital formation was identified both in demand-side and supply side analyses.

Title:  Career strategies of employees of MNC in the globalization reign
Abstract:  The paper analyses the pattern of career choice among the fresh recruits in multinational corporations. The paper finds that competence skills that are required within a borderless corporation tend to positively influence the employee satisfaction and expectation at the early stages of his/her career. The work environment prevalent at such peculiar and dominant corporations usually exceeds developing country corporate practices that are common within a local market landscape. We finally find that globalization favors the work culture to the benefit of its employees.

Title:  Public policies that can be implemented to struggle with celiac disease in Turkey
Abstract:  Celiac is a digestive disorder that damages the small intestine by the ingestion of a substance, called gluten that is found in cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye and oats. The ingested foods are broken down into their components and got into the blood thanks to the projections, called villus, in the small intestine. Foods containing gluten reduce the surface area of the intestine by damaging the villus projections and foods are rendered into a non-absorbable form. As a result, nutritional deficiency along with many problems will arise. The only treatment for patients with celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. There are many problems present from unavailability of gluten-free products to the high cost. The state may intervene in celiac disease for reasons such as imperfect information, external costs, public goods, principal-agent problem, imperfect competition conditions and demerit goods. The aim of the study is to raise awareness for celiac disease in Turkey and to develop public policy recommendations that can be implemented in struggling with the disease.

Title:  The psychology theories of waqf-giving behaviors
Abstract:  Waqf has been practiced among Muslims since long ago and many studies have been conducted on waqf in various sectors. Thus, this paper reviews the relevant literature on waqf as mechanism to know the giving behavior among Muslim. The prime objective is to study factors that influence the intention to participate in waqf together with the motivational factors that drive and direct once to act. The findings show that the theory of planned behavior combined with other fundamental behavior together with the four drives factors sorted from different studies can be used to explain the waqf-giving behaviors. The paper then developed and proposed a conceptual model to study human behavior. Such evaluations could serve as a guideline in understanding the behavior that needs to be instilled to increase giving behavior among Muslims. This paper presents a conceptual model of waqf-giving behaviors, which would be useful for further empirical research in this area.

Title:  Disruptive firms and industrial change
Abstract:  This study proposes the concept of disruptive firms: they are firms with market leadership that deliberate introduce new and improved generations of durable goods that destroy, directly or indirectly, similar products present in markets in order to support their competitive advantage and/or market leadership. These disruptive firms support technological and industrial change and induce consumers to buy new products to adapt to new socioeconomic environment. In particular, disruptive firms generate and spread path-breaking innovations in order to achieve and sustain the goal of a (temporary) profit monopoly. This organizational behaviour and strategy of disruptive firms support technological change. This study can be useful for bringing a new perspective to explain and generalize one of the determinants that generates technological and industrial change. Overall, then this study suggests that one of the general sources of technological change is due to disruptive firms (subjects), rather than disruptive technologies (objects), that generate market shifts in a Schumpeterian world of innovation-based competition.

Title:  Trends in globalization of select Asian countries
Abstract:  In this study we have constructed a composite index of globalization of select Asian countries during 1970-2014 by minimizing the Euclidean norm of Shapley values of indicator variables contributing to the overall index. As a consequence, the mean expected marginal contributions of constituent variables to the overall index are approximately equal and thus, the overall composite index represents the constituent variables optimally. We call this index the Almost Equal Marginal Contribution (AEMC) index. We find that AEMC index and the KOF index of globalization are highly correlated (Pearson’s r=0.982).  We find that Singapore, Cyprus, Israel, Qatar, Malaysia, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Kuwait, Bahrain and Japan have done very well and scored above 0.7. At the other end, Yemen, Tajikistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Iran, Nepal and Myanmar have scored below 0.5. Trends in globalization are increasing in general, but the rate of globalization, which accelerated after 1991, lost its momentum after 2007. Disparities in globalization, as measured by Gini coefficient over the countries under study, were more or less constant up to 1985 but after that they started declining. We have found that the index of globalization goes well with other socio-economic measures such as Economic Freedom Index, International Innovation Index, Social Progress Index, Human Development Index and Corruption Perception Index, showing high values of Kendall’s Tau and Spearman’s Rho. Its association with Democracy Index is rather weak but positive. It is almost uncorrelated with the Gender Gap Index. We observe, therefore, that globalization index is moving well with the indices of socio-economic condition in the Asian countries.

Title:  The socio-economic and business relationships between Turkish and Nigeria
Abstract:  Nigeria is a country colonized by Britain in 19th century and got its independence in 1960 with the condition of remaining as one of the Commonwealth of Nations. Nigeria is a West African Nation with apopulation of 200 million people. Is a country endowed with many natural resources and at the same time the highest petrol exporter among African countries. Nigeria has also huge amount of Natural Gas. The country has 910.802 km2 of land mass. %49.9 of Nigerians live in urban centres while %51.1 live in village areas. As a result of the fall of petrol prices in 2014 Nigeria’s economy has decreased by -%6.3 and later appreciated a litle bit by %2.7. In 2016 the economy has decreased by -%2.2. The inflation rate in 2015 was %9 while it doubled to %18.8 in 2016. The major challenges of Nigeria’s economic growth are the lack of enough investors, energy bottleneck, bad leadership and inadequate Access to fund for private sector. Another problem faced by the economy of Nigeria is bribery and corruption. Additionally, the Boko Haram crises make foreign investors to run away from the country. The attacks on oil companies, wells and installation in the oil-rich Niger Delta region together with the abduction of foreign nationals have negatively affected Nigeria’s economy. As a result of these poverty and joblessness become the order of the day. Nigeria being rich in petrol and natural gas resources can be said to become Turkey’s strategic business partner. Turkey Nigeria relationship dated back to 1960s. Since this period to date, Turkey and Nigeria cooperated in the areas of economic development, education and defence. There are almost 3 thousand Nigerian studentsstudying in different Universities across Turkey. In 2015 25 thousand Nigerian tourists visited Turkey. In the last years due to the ability of 19 Turkish Universities to be among the best Universities in the world, Turkey has experinced great flood of foreign students. Due to this the review of the economic resources of the two countries will benefit both. In this work Turkey-Nigeria economic relationships would be examined and analysed.

Title:  Econometrics analysis and application of event study methodology on international mergers and acquisition activities of MNCs from Eastern Europe
Abstract:  The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of financial crisis on the International Expansion activities of MNCs from Eastern Europe. This study has two interrelated foci. The fist one provides an empirical analysis of international expansion activities that span around the period of 2006 – 2016. The second focus examines market reaction to the announcements of international mergers and acquisations actualized by these firms to see whether there is any value creation for firms in these activities. The paper utilizes Securities Database (SDC) Platinum Worldwide Mergers and Acquisitions database in examining 621 international mergers and acquisitions activities of various MNCs from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. In order to assess value creation, the paper utilizes Event Study Methodology. Overall, the results suggest that Eastern European firms’ global mergers and acquisition activities increase during the beginning of financial crisis, but later the activities have slowed down. Hence, the study indicates that the effects of crisis on these firms’ activities were not immediate but began recently as their activities decreased since the beginning of 2009. Event Study results does not indicate value creation.

Title:  The origins of the economics of Innovation
Abstract:  This study suggests that the origins of the economics of technical change go back to many years before Schumpeter’s contributions. The Scottish philosopher John Rae with his book Statement of Some New Principles on the Subject of Political Economy, issued in 1834, put forward the basis of the Economics of innovation individuating the nature, causes of technological innovations (e.g., steam engine) and effects of technological progress on economic growth of nations. Rae also discusses the evolution and role of vital technologies for the wealth and employment in Europe and North America. Overall, then, Rae’s work is basic for the origin of the Economics of innovation, for defining the domain of this discipline and for explaining the effects of vital technologies in society. However, the conclusions of this study are tentative. There is need for much more detailed research into this research topic.

Title:  Expectations versus reality of Pakistan China FTA
Abstract:  Pakistan-China FTA was implemented with lot of fanfare and was expected to improve Pakistani export potential and business competitiveness. However, the successive governments failed to improve local competitiveness through effective regulation resulting in (a) missed opportunity to exploit the FTA to the benefit of Pakistan and (b) a trade balance favouring only China.

Title:  Controlling information asymmetry in equity crowdfunding
Abstract:  Crowdfunding is a fast developing method of projects finance mobilization. However, weakness of trust and the associated problem of information asymmetry constrain risk sharing investments as well as equity crowdfunding. Reputation mechanism is one of the newest ways to address asymmetric information issue in web-based social networks. A reputational mechanism has been designed and named “Fame” in this paper specifically for equity crowdfunding systems to eliminate moral hazard and reduce asymmetric information. The term “Fame” is meant to capture the qualitative aspects of reputation such as trustworthiness, credibility, reliability of every individual member of an equity crowdfunding system. Fame is systematic, countable and computable (implicit and explicit) reputation monitoring mechanism. A game theory approach is employed using two different games: “without Fame” and “with Fame” games, to show that a “with Fame” crowdfunding game leads to better results. Moreover, net aggregate surplus in “with Fame” crowdfunding is larger than “without Fame” crowdfunding system.

Title:  Differences in wealth, evidence from structural regression decomposition, 1850-1870 
Abstract:  Recent studies have used regression decomposition to analyze recent data and found that over seventy percent of the black-white wealth differences remained unexplained (See, e.g., Gittleman & Wolff 2000; Altonji, Doraszelski & Segal 2000; and Blau & Graham 1990). Their results are limited to the variation in modern data. This study contributes improved methodology and historical empirical results to the literature on economic discrimination. In this paper, (i) presents structural regression decompositions, which are modifications to methods developed by Becker (1957) and Oaxaca (1973); (ii) presents a basic empirical test when analyzing structural regression decompositions; (iii) reports the estimated sources of black-white differences in wealth directly before and after emancipation; (iv) links these findings to recent studies. Empirical estimates confirm that the size and persistence of modern black-white wealth differences have historical roots. (v) presents decision-making considerations of “individuals” in an economy with grouped individuals, owners of firms, and social planner(s), conditional on wealth constraints with applied social economic considerations.

Title:  Energy, CO2s and water on the African Continent
Abstract:  African nations share a common situation in that they pollute little in terms of CO2s globally speaking, but at the same time global warming will likely have terrible consequences for the continent, set to face a sharp population increase. They have now access to few energy resources, which is conducive to their poverty. New renewables belong to the future (solar, wind, geo-thermal), whereas old renewables -wood, coal-– are a thing of the past. The coal or oil and gas dependent giants must start energy transformation, as must the many countries relying upon traditional biomass, or charcoal. The use of wood coal is simply too large for the survival of the African forests. Africa need lots of energy to handle the coming crisis ofpotable water, as lakes and rivers are shrinking and degraded by pollution, dams and overfishing.

Title:  Impact of governing modeson agrarian sustainability in Bulgaria
Abstract:  Specific system of governance in different countries, regions, subsectors, etc., eventually determines the speed and type of socio-economic development. Despite its big academic and practical importance, in Bulgaria and other countries in East Europe, there are very few empirical studies on dominating governing structures in agriculture, and their impact(s) on agrarian sustainability. In this paper the interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics framework is incorporated, and the impact of diverse market, private, collective, public and hybrid modes of governance on agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development in Bulgaria assessed. First, the methodological framework of the study is outlined. After that dominating governing modes in Bulgarian farms of different juridical type, size, specialization, ecological and geographical location are identified, and their impacts on agrarian sustainability and its economic, social, and environmental pillars evaluated. In conclusion implications for further research, public policy improvement, and private managerial strategy formation are presented. Agricultural producers of different use quite unlike mixture of effective market, private, collective and hybrid modes for governance of their activities and relations. Individual factors and modes most contributing to improvement of agrarian sustainability at the current stage of development are: manager’s personal convictions and initiatives, farms resources and innovation potential, near future profit and benefits strategies, market prices levels and dynamics, area-based EU subsidies, and informal agreements. Research on relations between the governing structure and agrarian sustainability is to continue though increasing representation, and the spectrum of specific governing modes used by farms of different type as well as assessments of the impact of institutions on agrarian sustainability and the impact of the governance at different hierarchical levels. The latter however, requires a new kind of micro and macro data, and a close cooperation between all interested parties.

Title: Legacies of rational expectations, Lucas’s contributions, and philosophy of time and existence
Abstract: This study aims to clarify the legacies of rational expectations and Lucas’s contributions to macroeconomics. The study also aims to explore the philosophical implications of rational expectations, especially in relation to the philosophy of time and existence. The study finds that rational expectations have had a significant impact on macroeconomic theory and policy. Lucas’s contributions, particularly his critique of Keynesian economics and his development of the Lucas critique, have been instrumental in shaping modern macroeconomics. The study also finds that rational expectations have philosophical implications, particularly in relation to the concept of time and the nature of existence. The study concludes that rational expectations and Lucas’s contributions have had a profound impact on both economics and philosophy.

Title: Human progress and its socioeconomic effects in society
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to suggest a definition of human progress given by: an inexhaustible process driven by an ideal of maximum wellbeing of purposeful people which, on attainment of any of its objectives for increasing wellbeing, then seek another consequential objective. The human progress improves the fundamental life-interests of people represented by health, wealth, expansion of knowledge, technology and freedom directed to increase wellbeing throughout the society. These factors support the acquisition by humanity of better and more complex forms of life. However, this study also shows the inconsistency of the equation economic growth = progress because human progress also generates negative effects for human being, environment and society, such as increasing incidence of cancer in advanced countries.

Abstract: This brief note looks at the suggested use of universal banking as a tool to mitigating risk in financing operations’ arising at both ends of the market – demand and supply. It concludes that the issue of adopting universal banking in the Islamic system is of little significance for risk reduction. It essentially raises the issue of mega banks versus smaller units in the Islamic system where the discretion would opt for the latter.

Title: The political economy of fiscal deficits in the UK
Abstract: The focus of this study is on aspects of public debt and austerity policy in the UK. It attempts to provide an evaluation of fiscal policy under neoliberalism and to consider the relationship between this policy and the macroeconomic performance of the UK economy. There also seems to be ambiguities among the policy makers about austerity. Therefore, it seems important to examine the issue of government imposed austerity policies and fiscal deficits. There is need to borrow to cover the deficits as there is no inflationary pressure in the UK. Most democratic solutions against any inflationary pressures are to reduce money in circulation through higher taxes. Further I argue that a number of counter measures could possibly be taken such as placing a requirement on financial institutions such as pension funds to place some minimum proportion of their asset portfolio into government stock.

Title: A note on computing the standard errors of estimate of composite index
Abstract: This short note proposes working out of the standard errors of estimate of composite indices when they are constructed by using intrinsically derived weights. It illustrates the proposed method, using the jackknife re-sampling technique, by an example that relates to crime of different types in Uttar Pradesh (India). Improvements are suggested through bootstrapping.

Title: Revisiting economic integration in West Africa: A theoretical exposition
Abstract: The signing of regional trade agreement between the Economic Community of West African State and Switzerland in 2017 provides a renewed and ambitious blueprint for economic integration and developmental strategies in West Africa. However, one of the remarkable features of the historic event was the relative lack of analysis of the significant issues and problem of regional aspiration and integration before the treaty was drafted. Bearing this in mind, it appears that the theoretical persuasion of economic integration may have attracted this commitment since it provides a better understanding on the economic mechanism through which a regional cooperation could enhance both static and dynamic benefits among partnering countries. For better consideration of the implication of this move, this study identifies the main trends in economic integration theories and also flashlight on how these theories were developed. The motivations that led to the need for innovative approaches to enrich economic theory of economic integration were based on its implication or impact on West African region. Although several researchers have tried to explain the phenomenon of economic integration, we cannot say there is a generally accepted theory, since some of the already suggested theories and criticisms has its consequences on the region. Hence, this study is suggesting domesticated theories that will suite the contextual analysis of African region rather than adopting theories meant for developed and more vibrant economy.

Title: Interrelationships between Violent crime, demographic and socioeconomic factors: a preliminary analysis between Central-Northern European countries and Mediterranean countries
Abstract: The paper here investigates possible relationships between violent crime, migration and unemployment. Results seem to show an association between some crimes - such as theft, assaults and sexual violence - and immigration but not between intentional homicides and immigration. Preliminary evidence also suggests that intentional homicides are associated with high rates of unemployment, linking this violent crime to socioeconomic and situational factors within countries. In addition, unlike commonplace opinions, statistical evidence here reveals that rich countries have levels of violent crime higher than poor countries. Especially, violent crime in central-northern European regions (geo-economic areas with high GDP per capita, e.g., Germany, Finland, Norway, etc.) is higher than Mediterranean countries with lower GDP per capita (e.g., Greece, Italy, Spain, etc.). These conclusions are of course tentative. There is need for much more detailed research into the relations between unemployment, immigration and violent crime to explain general causes of these social issues in modern economies. This study concludes with some socioeconomic implications and explanations.

Title: Economics, education and religion: Can Western theories be generalized across religions?
Abstract: Some of the recent empirical studies relate economic growth and prosperity with religion. This paper raises the question that if economic systems are based on individualism and selfishness, can they be related with religion? The paper also finds that the Secularization hypothesis of Western Modernity is still valid for Western cultures, Judaism and Christianity but its application is highly unlikely in case of the third monotheist religion Islam. The paper expounds the causes of this proposition keeping in view the historical, religious and economic perspectives of Islam.

Title: South Sudan: The dilemma of a protracted social conflict
Abstract: This study examined the conflict in South Sudan, which started in December 2013 due to political dissatisfaction between President Salva Kiir and his then Vice President Riek Machar. When South Sudan got independence in 2011 through a referendum where more-than 98 percent of the population supported secession from Sudan, the country became a case study for potential secessions in Africa. However, the euphoria of independence quickly evaporated, and immediately replaced by violent conflict. Thus, the study explored the major causes of the conflict and concluded that political discontent resulting from power struggle among the elites fuelled the conflict. Furthermore, the study argues that citing ethnicity as the fundamental cause of the conflict is misleading and ill-conceived. Rather than being the catalyst of the conflict, the present conflict in South Sudan has rekindled ethnic identities and ideologies to a record height. The new wave of ethnic sentiment in South Sudan is as a result of irrational quest for political power and control among the top echelons in the country. Although ethnicity is not considered as the main cause of the conflict, however, given that the present situation has invigorated ethnic identities and sentiments in the country, the study concludes that any viable solution to the conflict must give incentives to fair ethnic and inter-ethnic representation and coalitions.

Title: The impact of financial development on income inequality in China
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of financial development on income inequality in China. Using panel data from 31 provinces in China from 2000 to 2015, the study finds that financial development has a significant negative effect on income inequality. The results suggest that financial development can reduce income inequality by improving access to financial services and promoting economic growth. The study also finds that the effect of financial development on income inequality varies across regions and over time. The findings have important policy implications for promoting inclusive growth and reducing income inequality in China.

Title: Technological Parasitism
Abstract: Technological parasitism is a new theory to explain the evolution of technology in society. In this context, this study proposes a model to analyze the interaction between a host technology (system) and a parasitic technology (subsystem) to explain evolutionary pathways of technologies as complex systems. The coefficient of evolutionary growth of the model here indicates the typology of evolution of parasitic technology in relation to host technology: i.e., underdevelopment, growth and development. This approach is illustrated with realistic examples using empirical data of product and process technologies. Overall, then, the theory of technological parasitism can be useful for bringing a new perspective to explain and generalize the evolution of technology and predict which innovations are likely to evolve rapidly in society.

Title: The balancing act: US recession 2020 and the Federal Reserve
Abstract: The paper shows that there is a tradeoff between higher wages and higher employment when Federal Reserve through its monetary policy tools is trying to avoid a looming recession. The paper also explains the rationale behind President Donald Trump’s industrial policy and timely actions by the Fed to raise interest rates by presenting it not as contradictions but as conciliation measures. The paper utilizes unique perception based data collected by world economic survey on some key indicators of the US economy to discuss a strong possibility of mild economic recession in 2020 in the US. However, it is expected that the Federal Reserve would take some timely measures like the devaluation of US dollar and decreasing interest rates that may off set the drastic effects of a continuing trade war with China on the external sector of the country. The economic policies of Trump administration have brought greater focus to industrial labor that has strengthened the white supremacy rhetoric in the country. The concept paper discusses specific activity based informal education exercise in the schools in US that may help the young population in the country to consolidate with diversity and reject populism of dissent against diversity and movements of white supremacy.
