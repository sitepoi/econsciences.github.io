Title: The March Towards Poverty: Why the Labour Government has much more to deal with than the economic consequences of Covid-19 in its upcoming budget
Abstract: This article examines the structural and policy-driven challenges facing New Zealand’s Labour Government beyond the immediate economic fallout of Covid-19. It argues that long-term welfare dependency, declining productivity, and unsustainable fiscal commitments pose deeper threats to economic resilience. The authors advocate for reforms in welfare, education, and public finance to reverse the trajectory toward poverty.

Title: In utero exposure to Ramadan and Birth Outcomes: Evidence from a triple difference approach
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of fetal exposure to Ramadan fasting on birth outcomes using a triple difference methodology. Drawing on Iranian birth registry data, the paper finds that in utero exposure to Ramadan is associated with lower birth weights and shorter gestational periods, particularly among rural and low-income populations. The findings have implications for maternal health policy in Muslim-majority countries.
Classification-JEL: I15, J13, C21.
Keywords: Ramadan, birth outcomes, maternal health, triple difference, Iran.
